<div class='post'>
<p>I was just burned by an issue in Play Framework's JPA support of orphanRemovals. The issue manifests as a "collection owner not associated with session" JPAException within Play Framework 1.2.x &nbsp;- it was supposed to be <a href="https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/57987/tickets/1503-nested-onetomany-relationships-with-orphanremoval-fails-to-commit">addressed in 1.2.5 with this patch,</a> but I'm running 1.2.5 and am still running into it.</p><p>I didn't take the time to diagnose or file a report - for now I'm punting by restricting the use of 'orphanRemoval'.</p></div>
