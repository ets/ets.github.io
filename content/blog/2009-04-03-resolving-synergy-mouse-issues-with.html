My desktop runs Ubuntu (64-bit) and I use Synergy to drive its keyboard and mouse over to various clients like my MacBook Pro.After my upgrade to Ubuntu 8.04 my Synergy-driven mouse exhibited truly bizarre behavior while interacting with Firefox on my Mac. DHTML didn't function normally, dropdown menus were inaccessible, flash interactions were also hit-or-miss...<p />At first I blamed Firefox since Safari exhibited no such issues, but after a bit of trial and error I decided to compile Synergy server from source on my Ubuntu box. I killed the Ubuntu packaged Synergy server and launched my self-compiled binary. The new server resolved all the issues.<p />Another win for open source software...</div>
