<div class='post'>
<p><span> </span><a href="http://foldergrid.com">FolderGrid</a> provides a RESTful api that often services requests where over 90% of the entire response time is spent pulling data from a MySQL instance. I was recently working to reduce overall response time for some long running transactions in that bucket.</p><p><span> </span>After optimizing my queries and my database caching - I looked at network transfer time from the dedicated MySQL server to the mysql client on the application server. &nbsp;Simply enabling MySQL zlib compression resulted in a 3x performance boost for many of the larger resultsets.&nbsp;</p><p><span> </span>To configure your Play Framework connection pool to enable MySQL client-server zlib compression, you'll need to use the explicitly defined "db.url" instead of the shortcut "db" configuration key. Your key should look something like this:</p><p>db.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost/dbname?useUnicode=yes&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp;connectionCollation=utf8_general_ci&amp;useCompression=true</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
