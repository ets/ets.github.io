<div class='post'>
<p>While attempting to make a large object graph serializable I kept encountering NotSerializableExceptions regarding my Log references which were instances of&nbsp;SLF4JLocationAwareLog. The references were declared transient so I beat my head on a wall for a few hours before upgrading my slf4j version from 1.4.2 to 1.5.8</p><p>Somewhat frustratingly - that resolved the issue. No idea why.</p></div>
