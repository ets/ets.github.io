Andrej Karpathy has posted some incredible content - one of the [best explanations of backpropagation and the training of neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) I've come across.

The video walks through his [Micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) in detail, demonstrating just how little code is really necessary to implement a neural network. All the other complexities, as Karpathy explains, are just efficiencies. Great stuff!
