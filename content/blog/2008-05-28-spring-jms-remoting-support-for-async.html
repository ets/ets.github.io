<div class='post'>
I've submitted a patch to the Spring Framework to give their <a href="http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4427">JMS remoting feature support for async calls and methods with void return types</a>. The associated Jira ticket (<a href="http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4427">SPR-4427</a>) could use a few votes if you are so inclined.</div>
