<div class='post'>
So my upgrade to Verizon FiOS included swapping my Linksys WRT54G access point for the Verizon branded ActionTec device that came with the FiOS install. This swap wasn't strictly necessary, but the ActionTec doubles as both the router and access point so I decided I might as well make use of the wireless capabilities since I have to keep it plugged in either way.The only problem I encountered was that my Linksys WRT54G bridge couldn't play nice with the ActionTec. Through trial and error I found that setting both devices to encrypt using WPA2-PSK using AES only (not the default TKIP+AES) resolved my issues.</div>
