After removing a secondary monitor from a MacBook, some apps do not properly re-position themselves on your laptop display. KeePassX is one such offender and I was previously manually editing ~/.keepass/config and restarting KeePassX in order to resolve the issue.I came across <a href="http://blog.bittube.com/2008/05/08/moving-application-windows-in-os-x-via-apple-script/comment-page-1/#comment-100554">a much nicer solution on bittube</a>. The solution is great, but the source found there is a bit tricky to copy &amp; paste so I've re-posted here for posterity. Enjoy!<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>property processesToIgnore : {}tell application &quot;Finder&quot;set _b to bounds of window of desktopset screen_width to item 3 of _bset screen_height to item 4 of _bend telltell application &quot;System Events&quot;set allProcesses to application processesset _results to &quot;&quot;repeat with i from 1 to count allProcessesset doIt to 1repeat with z from 1 to count processesToIgnoreif process i = process (item z of processesToIgnore) thenset doIt to 0end ifend repeatif doIt = 1 thentell process irepeat with x from 1 to (count windows)set winPos to position of window xset _x to item 1 of winPosset _y to item 2 of winPosif (_x &lt; 0 or _y  screen_width or _y &gt; screen_height) thenset position of window x to {0, 22}end ifend repeatend tellend ifend repeatend tell</pre></div></div></div>
