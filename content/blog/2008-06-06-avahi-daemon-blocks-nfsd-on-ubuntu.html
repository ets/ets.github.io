<div class='post'>
I just spent a morning attempting to fix a <a href="http://www.jroller.com/agileanswers/entry/mounting_an_ubuntu_nfs_share">NFS mounting configuration</a> that had been working flawlessly for over 6 months. My daemon log was showing this:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>nfssvc: writing fds to kernel failed: errno 98 (Address already in use)</pre></div></div><br />After much angst, I finally stumbled upon <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2007/01/msg00343.html">this posting</a> that mentioned a conflict between avahi-daemon and NFSd. After a quick "apt-get remove avahi-daemon", all is well with the world.</div>
