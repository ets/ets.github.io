I run Leopard on my Mac and encountered the dreaded Error 51 issue today. The simple fix that worked for me was to run the following two commands as root:<p /><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre># ifconfig fw0 down# /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN restart</pre></div></div>Afterwords, the VPN client started just fine...no Error 51.</div>
