<p>Sense.fm's <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/sense.fm">domain registration expired Sept. 16th</a> - oops. That makes their website and streams inaccessible through normal means until they are able to resolve the registry issues.</p><p>The good news is that they are continuing to broadcast so if you simply bypass the DNS network you can get around the issue and get your Sense.fm fix.</p><p>The easiest way to work around the issue is to add an entry to your hosts file. A quick dig of their nameservers (ns1.webpartnersworldwide.com) shows us the IP address we need is&nbsp;174.121.134.99.</p><p>So we want to add the following to our hosts file:</p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>174.121.134.99 sense.fm <a href="http://www.sense.fm">www.sense.fm</a></p></blockquote><p>On sane systems like my Mac the hosts file is /etc/hosts but on Windows it's usually&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:12px;line-height:18px;">c:windowssystem32driversetchosts</span></p><p>After you add the sense.fm line to your hosts file just open your browser and visit <a href="http://www.sense.fm">www.sense.fm</a>&nbsp;like normal.</p><p>You're welcome!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p /><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
