<p><span style="font-size:large;">1. Install Lion</span></p><p>If you heard about the small business 20-pack of licences Apple offered when they announced Lion and think you might want to go that route - don't. &nbsp;Trust me. &nbsp;They can take your payment but they just can't fulfill your order ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7uvttu8ct0">and that's really the most important part</a>. Two months later I have a micro USB drive and am finally starting the upgrades.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">2. Use App Store to download &amp; install XCode</span></p><p>Annoying. At least they fixed the download process to support resumes. Mine cutoff at 98% of the 4G download but picked back up where it left off on resume.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">3. Run &nbsp;"/Applications/Install Xcode.app"</span></p><p>So when App Store said it was "Installing Xcode" it meant it was installing the Xcode installer. Sadly, it took me a while to figure this one out ... and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2786661?start=0&amp;tstart=0">I am not alone</a>.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">4. Install MacPorts 2.0.3 or greater</span></p><p><a href="https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.0.3-10.7-Lion.dmg">MacPorts install for Lion</a> worked the first time with no hassle - Apple could learn a thing or two.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">5. Run "port upgrade outdated"</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-size:small;">This takes some time but ran without error for me...nice.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;">6. Update php.ini</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-size:small;"><a href="http://maccrazy.com/lion-upgrade-killed-my-php-site-and-how-i-fixed-it">Lion upgrades to PHP 2.3.0 </a>and saves but disables your existing php.ini - at a minimum you'll need to update your mysql socket entries to point to the same place as your my.cnf&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;">7. Install a JDK</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-size:small;">I attempted to run a Java driven app (LibreOffice) and Lion magically prompted me to install Java. I let it and the install process flawlessly&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:small;">setup a full JDK instead of just a JRE</span><span style="font-size:small;">&nbsp;- nice job Apple.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;">8. Toggle trackpad scroll direction</span></p><p><span style="font-size:small;">If all my devices used Lion I'm certain I'd adapt to the inverted scrolling in just a few hours - but they don't and that causes wheel spinning everytime I begin a Lion based session. &nbsp;I see no net benefit so it's not worth the pain. &nbsp;System Preferences -&gt; Trackpad -&gt; Scroll direction -&gt; unchceck</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;">9. Install the updated Server tools</span></p><p><span style="font-size:small;">If you run a Mac Server and want to use your Lion workstation to manage its services...you need the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1419">updated Mac Server Tools</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:large;">10. Disable Dashboard</span></p><p><span style="font-size:small;">I don't care for widgets.</span></p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES<br />killall Dock</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-size:large;">11. Install JDK source</span></p><p>Grab the Java for Mac OS X 10.7 Developer Package from&nbsp;<a href="http://connect.apple.com/" title="Apple Developer Download" target="_blank" style="vertical-align:baseline;color:#990000;font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height:23px;padding:0;margin:0;">http://connect.apple.com/<br /></a>It'll put the src.jar here</p><p><span style="color:#333333;font-family:Monaco, Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:12px;line-height:15px;">/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0_26-b03-383.jdk/Contents/Home/src.jar</span></p></div>
