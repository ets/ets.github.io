<p>Setting up my new QA server should have been simple, but a cryptic issue with Resin cost me five hours. Here's the rundown so you can learn from my pain.</p><p>I copied my production copy of Resin over to a new QA server which is more or less identical - both run RHEL5 with the same version of openssl and same Java runtime. It fired up an ran perfectly...there were only two things I wanted to change. I wanted to:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to the latest version of Resin - from 3.1.7 to 3.1.9</li><li>Install a new SSL certificate to match the QA server's hostname</li></ul>The task at hand looked so simple I decided to make both changes at once without testing in between....big mistake. I flew through the upgrade process and grabbed a new certificate from GoDaddy (the same CA used for the existing certificate). When I fired up the new Resin it started with no errors but when I attempted to pull a page over SSL my browser returned a "no common encryption algorithms" error.<p>I thought support for certain algorithms must have changed in the latest release and thus spent an inordinate amount of time chasing my tail in the belief that the issue was related to the Resin minor version upgrade. After recognizing that dead-end, I ran through every openssl test I knew and learned a few more along the way. After much trial and error I finally noticed my mistake. I was still using the certificate-chain-file associated with the production certificate.</p><p>The first certificate in a certificate chain file is <b>your</b> server/domain certificate. Thus, I needed to replace the first certificate in the chain in order to use it with my QA server. That took two minutes...then all was well with SSL support in my new QA server.</p></div>
