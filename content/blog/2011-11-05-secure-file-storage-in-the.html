<p>In my quest for the perfect sync for the relatively small set of sensitive files I want available from all my workstations I've tried several cloud based services: Dropbox, JungleDisk,&nbsp;Wuala, and Egnyte just to name a few.</p><p>Dropbox and JungleDisk both require custom-rolled workarounds (like using a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> volume) to keep sensitive files secured. Egnyt encrypts your data at rest but they use a common key which means you are reliant upon their business practices for data security. Wuala encrypts your data with a private key before transmitting it, but their client is quite cumbersome. I've found&nbsp;<a href="https://spideroak.com/download/referral/5f97e6c2cc2ab96167bc1ed3c92b9c09">SpiderOak</a> to be the best fit for my needs.</p><ul><li>Native Mac client that starts automatically and runs quietly in the tray</li><li>Zero-knowledge encryption of all my files</li><li>Supports a smart folder sync&nbsp;</li><li>Free entry-level account with 2G of space</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
