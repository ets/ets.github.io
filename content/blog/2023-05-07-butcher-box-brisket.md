Most of my brisket cuts are coming from [ButcherBox](http://rwrd.io/2gt3oo5?c) these days and are under 5lbs instead of the typical 12lbs "full packer". Don't follow the timings in a recipe for the latter if you are cooking the former - unless you enjoy eating shoe leather.  I'm constantly modifying my default approach, but here's one that has served well recently:

- salt + pepper + paprika + onion powder => rubbed into the brisket the night before your cook
- setup your Big Green Egg for indirect heat at 225
- throw some wettened chunks of Apple wood on the coals and a catch tray filled with water under the grate
- brisket fat side up onto the grate over the tray and cook to the center reads 165
- pull meat off and double wrap in aluminum foil transfer to oven at 210
- cook till center reads 205
- throw wrapped brisket into an empty cooler and let it rest for at least an hour...up to 4
- yum
