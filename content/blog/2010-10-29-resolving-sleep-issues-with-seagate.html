There are number of posts on Seagate's user forums describing <a href="http://forums.seagate.com/t5/FreeAgent-Products/How-to-stop-Seagate-FreeAgent-Desktop-Drives-from-going-to-sleep/m-p/8812">frustration with the GoFlex line of external harddrive</a> and its <a href="http://forums.seagate.com/t5/FreeAgent-Products/FreeAgent-for-Mac-and-sleep/m-p/34138">tendency to periodically eject/sleep</a> on Mac's Snow Leopard. I'm using the 2TB GoFlex as my Time Machine drive and needed to resolve this annoyance as well. I've opened a ticket with Seagate Support directly, but so far they've been unable to completely resolve the issue.The only thing that seems to help is to go into System Prefs -&gt; Energy Saver and turn off the feature that puts Hard Drives to sleep. With that power saving feature disabled the Seagate only complains when my Mac actually wakes from sleep - that's an improvement but still no love.</div>
