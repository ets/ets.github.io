Blogger was just too ugly & clumsy so I used a fork of [juniorz's import.rb](https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581) to migrate from blogger to Octopress. Here's my fork:

I found [MeetDom's gist helpful while installing all the dependencies](https://gist.github.com/MeetDom/1713910) required by the import script.
