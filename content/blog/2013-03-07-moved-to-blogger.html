I started this <a href="http://www.jroller.com/agileanswers/">Agile Answers blog on jroller back in 2006</a> and I lost some of the older content in my move to Posterous. Sadly Twitter is killing Posterous so I've had to move again...this time to Google's Blogger. Alas - I've lost all the Posterous comments and a lot of formatting in the process. As if&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/theSeanCook">The Sean Cook</a>&nbsp;working there weren't reason enough, I now have one more reason to hate Twitter.<br /><br /><br /></div>
