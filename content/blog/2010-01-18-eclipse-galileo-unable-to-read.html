<div class='post'>
After a clean Snow Leopard install on a new machine, I fired up a fresh Galileo Eclipse and pointed it at a copy of my old workspace.&nbsp; I first encountered and resolved the missing Mac OS X JRE issue described in my last post, only to then find that my existing subversion repositories were inaccessible in the new Eclipse install. I hopefully added "-clean" as the first parameter of my eclipse.ini file and restarted but the situation remained unchanged. Undeterred, I launched eclipse from the command line with a -clean startup parameter and this did the trick:/Applications/&lt;your install dir/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse -clean</div>
