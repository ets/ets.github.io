<p>If you're attempting to upgrade to Firefox 4 on Mac and encounter this beauty <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Firefox4_lib_error" height="108" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/firefox4_lib_error-scaled500.png?w=300" width="399" /></div> then you'll need to perform the following terminal commands as an easy workaround.</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>cd /Library/LaunchDaemons/    sudo launchctl stop com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd    sudo launchctl unload com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist    killall vpnagentd</pre></div></div><p>Now attempt to install FireFox 4 again before issuing the following to reconfigure VPNAgent:</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>launchctl load com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist</pre></div></div><p>I've seen some other posts online suggesting that the killall command is sufficient, but that didn't work for me because vpnagentd was setup to automatically restart. The process I outlined here prevents that.</p></div>
