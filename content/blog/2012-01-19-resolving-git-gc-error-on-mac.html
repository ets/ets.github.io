<p>During today's maintenance run of git-gc on our Mac hosted repo I encountered screenfulls of nasty fatal error messages - but the last two were a clue to the root cause:</p><p><p>fatal: Unable to create temporary file: Too many open files<br />error: failed to run repack</p><p>This <a href="http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Intriguing-error-with-Git-1-6-3-1-Too-many-open-files-td7174697.html">related post helped me</a> find a quick cure which involved simply bumping the ulimit up temporarily.</p><p># ulimit -n 10024<br />&gt; git gc</p><p>Easy fix for a potentially bad day.</p></p></div>
