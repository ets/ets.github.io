<p>The reference client I built for <a href="http://foldergrid.com/api/index.html" title="FolderGrid API">FolderGrid's API </a>is a zero footprint web client created using <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS 4</a>. I wanted to support drag &amp; drop file uploads for advanced browsers but degrade nicely all the way back to IE6 for those poor lost souls stuck with tech from the last decade. So I integrated <a href="http://www.plupload.com/">plupload</a> and bound the two together with some jquery glue.</p><p>The results are working well in production and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ets/foldergrid-client-extjs/overview" title="FolderGrid Web Client">the client itself is open &amp; licensed under GPL v3</a> per the terms of ExtJS 4. So if you are interested in copying &amp; extending - have at it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
