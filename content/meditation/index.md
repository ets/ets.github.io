> Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. ― C.G. Jung

> The world is the totality of facts, not of things. ― Ludwig Wittgenstein

> You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end – which you cannot afford to lose – with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality,
> whatever they might be. ― James Bond Stockdale

“Tis a Fearful Thing

‘Tis a fearful thing
to love what death can touch.

A fearful thing
to love, to hope, to dream, to be –

to be,
And oh, to lose.

A thing for fools, this,

And a holy thing,

a holy thing
to love.

For your life has lived in me,
your laugh once lifted me,
your word was gift to me.

To remember this brings painful joy.

‘Tis a human thing, love,
a holy thing, to love
what death has touched.”

― Yehuda HaLevi
