AWS maintains a an excellent CloudFormation quickstart guide &amp; template here and it’s what I used to get started. After completing that guide I put a new entry for the Bastion host in my ssh config like so:123456Host bastion Hostname ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com User ec2-user IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/ssh-key.pem AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes Those last two lines are optional - but I like to leverage the Keychain on my MacBookPro for storing keys and their respective passphrases. Accepting the host key into your known_hosts file can avoid some pain going forward, so I recommend connecting directly to the bastion before continuing. To test my setup, I launched a EC2 instance in my private VPC and configured it in my ssh config like so:123456Host 10.100.*.* ProxyCommand ssh ec2-user@bastion -W %h:%p User ec2-user IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/ssh-key.pem AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes The magic happens on the second line with the ProxyCommand instructing SSH to jump through Bastion to route to any of the private IP addresses used in my development environment VPC. Unfortunately, my first attempt to connect failed. I poked around in the Bastion’s SSHD config and realized that the CloudFront template was so hardened that it wasn’t going to support the transparent sessions I wanted. I needed to modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following just below the PAM section:12PermitOpen anyAllowTCPForwarding yesAfter making the change be certain to restart the sshd service on Bastion. Part of the beauty of the CloudFormation design is that it uses an AutoScaling group to automatically tear down unresponsive Bastions and spin up replacements - even adapting to availability zone issues. When that happens the replacement Bastion will be configured with template defaults, so to ensure my sshd_config change would survive a failover, I copied the LaunchConfig and edited the user data to include the following:1perl -pi -0 -w -e &#x27;s/UsePAM yes/UsePam yes\\n\\n# Added by ets to support transparent pass through\\nPermitOpen any\\nAllowTCPForwarding yes/&#x27; sshd_configThen I replaced the currently configured LaunchConfig on my AutoScaling group with my copy. Now simply asking SSH to connect to my new services in the private VPC worked transparently!To make session more efficient using this type of proxy, I added the following to my Bastion host entry in ssh config:123ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%pControlMaster autoControlPersist 10m If you’re an ansible fan like me, you can take advantage of that same technique with a change to ansible.cfg:12ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=30mcontrol_path = ~/.ssh/ansible-%%r@%%h:%%p If you’re curious how to further protect your Bastion host with a whitelist for port 22 while also supporting users who are behind dynamic IPs then you’ll want to check out my aws-lambda-firewall project.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"AWS","slug":"AWS","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/AWS/"},{"name":"bastion","slug":"bastion","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/bastion/"},{"name":"jumphost","slug":"jumphost","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/jumphost/"}]},{"title":"Knock first firewall for AWS Security Groups","slug":"2017-05-16-aws-lambda-firewall","date":"2017-05-17T02:21:53.000Z","updated":"2022-06-14T23:36:27.309Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/05/16/2017-05-16-aws-lambda-firewall/","link":"","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/2017/05/16/2017-05-16-aws-lambda-firewall/","excerpt":"","text":"I recently setup a Bastion host to secure a development environment on AWS.

I’m retroactively posting some of the internal content I circulated as the technology leader at Social Tables - mostly high-level explanations of what my team was up to at the time. It’s been a fun ride with unique challenges and as I move on to my next post, I wanted to capture a few takeaways for posterity: Avoid greenfield rewrites of established applications. Specifics may warrant a true rewrite - but recognize the extreme risk to all involved if that’s the selected path. While I certainly agree with what Joel says about this here, I’ll add one more point of support - that a rewrite is a fight on two fronts. It’s up against the formidable foes of customer adoption of a new thing and the golden project phenomenon - where a golden (too big to fail) project’s scope continually increases without bound. Hire for squads and fire quickly on non-fit. My worst HR calls at Social Tables involved attempts to reassign an employee to a different team in an attempt to establish fit. This is especially difficult where the employee in question was inherited as opposed to hired under my watch. There’s a strong desire to give the inherited employee multiple chances to demonstrate fit. Don’t do it - if the employee is not a good enough for the first team she joins (or is assigned to) then do her and the rest of the team a favor - cut her loose with dignity. Such an evaluation might rightly not be considered fair - c’est la vie. Adopt 2-3 cutting-edge technologies, but no more. This worked really well for us - especially on the recruiting tip. Our best hires came through our broadcast of niche (at the time) tech such as WebGL, React, and RethinkDB. But it’s a double-edged sword. Our worst tech adoption failures came from naive pushes into Falcor, Dynamo, and Horizon.

Today we’re going to talk briefly about query tuning - a black art in the craft of software engineering that predates the Internet but is still incredibly relevant. I don’t mean relevant in the “you should really pay attention to national politics” sense. I mean relevant as in “this can (when done poorly) wreck your whole day.” What’s query tuning?A query is a request for information from a database. It can be as simple as “find the email address of the Social Tables user named Inigo Montoya”, or more complex like “find the ASP of all Social Tables opportunities closed on Fridays that followed a Thursday evening Happy Hour.” Since database structures are complex, in most cases, and especially for not-very-simple queries, the needed data for a query can be collected from a database by accessing it in different ways, through different data-structures, and in different orders. Each different way typically requires different processing time. Processing times of the same query may have large variance, from a fraction of a second to hours, depending on the way selected. The purpose of query tuning, is to find the way to process a given query in minimum time. What’s query tuning … in English (preferably with pictures) and how can it wreck my whole day?Query tuning is an effort to minimize the work performed while answering a query. If done poorly, database queries execute slowly and your application responds slowly. When your application responds slowly bad things happen - like Mary posting a screenshot to #devops (aka your whole day is wrecked). Last week, Michael Dumont spent some time tuning several queries in our platform and his visuals of that effort are worth &gt; 1,000 words: Orange = a measure of platform activityBlue = a measure of how hard the database is working Note: unlike Social Tables’ Engineers, our database refuses to work harder than 100% … so those blue peaks are signs of unhappy Social Tables users.

We’ve got a special subject this issue to take the edge off that geek-withdrawal : “Drawing Text with Signed Distance Fields” or using SDF text rendering for those in the know. What’s SDF?Signed distance field (SDF) is a technique for rendering bitmap fonts without jagged edges even at high magnifications. It was first introduced in 2007 with this bit of light reading by Valve and couples the use of a bitmap and glyphs with a GLSL shader that can sample and sharpen said glyphs. What’s SDF … in English (preferably with pictures)?So…you know what sounds easy but is really really hard? Drawing legible letters in Venue Mapper. Wait - what? Why’s that hard you ask? Here’s a screenshot of “Social Tables” rendered in 12pt font by Microsoft Word: Completely legible. But here’s that exact same image after I zoom in a few times: Not so great. Possibly legible but if we rendered text like this as users zoom in and out in Venue Mapper we’d have to bundle subscriptions with aspirin. SDF is a technique we’ve just begun using to more efficiently render text in Venue Mapper 3 - it performs better (app is faster) and looks prettier than the techniques we’ve used previously.

I initially blamed the lock on bad model design and wasted a significant amount of time tweaking JPA entity relationships and corresponding CRUD operations in an attempt to resolve it. I ultimately resolved the issue after realizing it was in fact caused by a badly designed test. I was directly modifying entities within the transaction that wrapped my functional test and then emulating API calls that relied upon the state of those same entities. Long story short, my test was attempting something similar to this: class FunctionalTest &#123; //Runs entire test in the same transaction setup()&#123; //reset H2 datastore in an distinct transaction &#125; atest()&#123; User u = User.findById(1); u.address = new Address(); u.save(); //test continues &#125; btest()&#123; Request req = GET(&quot;/user/1&quot;); &#125; &#125; In my contrived example above, after Junit runs atest() and just before running btest() - it will call setup() and attempt to reset the database in a separate transaction. But, atest() claimed a lock for insert on User and in H2 that locks the entire table by default thus setup() will be unable to reset the User table and will fail with a lock timeout.

Unfortunately, the latest releases of MAMP have attempted to restrict the utility of the stack in an effort to raise revenue through a less restricted \"Pro\" version. Developers on Snow Leopard are much better off moving to standalone installations of everything MAMP offers.There are many ways to install PHP, MySQL, Apache, and phpMyAdmin - all with a list of pros/cons. Without debating the merits, here's what I did to replace MAMP:1. Dump your MAMP Mysql databases and save them for import into your standalone MySQL installmysqldump --all-databases &gt; ~/old-mysql-data.sql2. Install a more recent copy of MySQL server than the one delivered with Snow LeopardI already had macports installed, so the choice here was easy. The following command installs the mysql binaries under /opt/local/bin/port install mysql5 mysql5-server3. Import your data into your new MySQL databaseFirst, be certain to shutdown all the MAMP servers (MySQL, Apache, etc...) - then start your new standalone MySQLsudo /opt/local/bin/mysqld_safe5 &amp;Finally, run the following:mysql 4. Install phpMyAdmin on the SL delivered Apache installationInstall it fresh, or just copy your MAMP installation to ~/Sites where it will be available under http://localhost/~your-username/5. Enable PHP5 on the SL delivered Apache installationOpen /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and enable the line: \"#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\" by removing the pound. Then in the Mac System Pref -&gt; Sharing, turn on (or if it was already on, turn off/on) Web Sharing. If you need to move any vhost or SSL config directives from MAMP to the SL Apache install, you'll make those changes to files in /etc/apache2/extra/6. Optional - Configure PHP by creating a php.ini under /etcI'm content to use the PHP installation already delivered by SL, but there is no default php.ini - simply create one under /etc and it'll be read automatically.You can now remove the MAMP training wheels and proceed developing with full standalone versions of your stack - happy trails.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"softwaredevelopment","slug":"softwaredevelopment","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/softwaredevelopment/"},{"name":"macintosh","slug":"macintosh","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/macintosh/"}]},{"title":"Support chroot for SCP connections on CentOS 5.5","slug":"2010-11-02-support-chroot-for-scp-connections-on","date":"2010-11-02T04:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-14T23:36:27.294Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/11/02/2010-11-02-support-chroot-for-scp-connections-on/","link":"","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/2010/11/02/2010-11-02-support-chroot-for-scp-connections-on/","excerpt":"","text":"Many thanks to anomie for posting this great writeup.

It's a nice concept that should make it much easier for a customer to locate support information and thereby reduce the number of support tickets generated.Customizing the public facing portals for my Cerberus installation was straightforward. The admin console provided a good degree of flexibility, but I wanted a bit more so I manually modified usermeet.core/templates/portal/sc/module/index.tpl in order to insert analytics scripts and some more detailed customization. That was easy, but my next mod proved more difficult. By default, Cerberus displays 10 articles on each page of search results and I wanted to increase that count to 20. Cerberus' architecture actually makes it a bit tricky to determine the control flow used by the community portals but I eventually traced the article retrieval flow to the DAO_KbArticle class in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/App.php and changed the default limit on the search method from 10 to 20. The limit is set as a hardcoded constant in the method signature....yuck. After the change, 20 articles were pulled from the database on each request, but there were still only 10 displayed in the portal.It took a lot of searching to find the missing piece and it was yet another hardcoded value in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/sc/kb.php where $view-&gt;renderLimit was set to 10. Changing this gave me the desired row count on the portal.The Cerberus team has put together a nice product but given that one of its core competitive features is its opensource nature, I'd like to see the codebase refactored to better facilitate this type of customization. Values like these limits could easily be defined in framework.config.php instead of scattering hardcoded settings across multiple files. That said, at least I had to option to manipulate the software - something I can't do with Kayako's offering.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"softwaredevelopment","slug":"softwaredevelopment","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/softwaredevelopment/"},{"name":"php","slug":"php","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/php/"},{"name":"cerberus","slug":"cerberus","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/tags/cerberus/"}]},{"title":"Connecting to Netscreen Series (NetScreen-5) VPN with Mac OS X (Snow Leopard)","slug":"2010-03-05-connecting-to-netscreen-series","date":"2010-03-05T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-06-14T23:36:27.291Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/03/05/2010-03-05-connecting-to-netscreen-series/","link":"","permalink":"http://ericsimmerman.com/2010/03/05/2010-03-05-connecting-to-netscreen-series/","excerpt":"","text":"(Followup to my NetScreen-5 from Ubuntu article) I recently struggled through the details of establishing a VPN connection from my Mac OS X desktop to a Juniper Networks Netscreen-5.

Here's the rundown so you can learn from my pain.I copied my production copy of Resin over to a new QA server which is more or less identical - both run RHEL5 with the same version of openssl and same Java runtime. It fired up an ran perfectly...there were only two things I wanted to change. I wanted to:Upgrade to the latest version of Resin - from 3.1.7 to 3.1.9Install a new SSL certificate to match the QA server's hostnameThe task at hand looked so simple I decided to make both changes at once without testing in between....big mistake. I flew through the upgrade process and grabbed a new certificate from GoDaddy (the same CA used for the existing certificate). When I fired up the new Resin it started with no errors but when I attempted to pull a page over SSL my browser returned a \"no common encryption algorithms\" error.I thought support for certain algorithms must have changed in the latest release and thus spent an inordinate amount of time chasing my tail in the belief that the issue was related to the Resin minor version upgrade. After recognizing that dead-end, I ran through every openssl test I knew and learned a few more along the way. After much trial and error I finally noticed my mistake.

Approximately 5 minutes after the disruption, I noticed thick black smoke billowing from a room housing several electronic devices. I was able to enter the room and identify the source of the smoke as the burning plastic of my Belkin \"Conceal\" Surge Protector. I was thankfully able to quickly terminate power to the device and remove the smoldering plastic from my home.As the attached photos demonstrate, the heat from the Belkin burned several holes into the baseboard of the wall behind it and charred the surrounding floor and wall. At the time of the incident, there were only three devices plugged into the Belkin: a speaker, halogen lamp, and laptop computer. Both the speaker and lamp were powered off and the laptop was only drawing power as needed to replenish its battery. Aside from damage to their power cords all three devices were unharmed. I purchased this Belkin Surge Protector from Staples on July 25th 2007 (I have the original receipt) and it was never damaged, repaired, or modified in any way prior to this incident.My wife &amp; eight-week old daughter were present in our home with me at the time of this incident. In addition to the obvious structural damage pictured, the room suffered significant smoke damage &amp; lingering odors from the toxic fumes. Clearly my family and I are lucky to have only experienced this relatively minor loss from such a potentially harmful incident. I am writing you today in the hope that this information may prevent other consumers from exposure to this potentially lethal &amp; hazardous product.I have kept the product and would be happy to submit it for your inspection.

I'll be working through the OpenLaszlo contributor process, but imagine that it could take a considerable amount of time before you see this work in their repository since I've not yet made any effort to adhere to any coding guidelines. There is very little documentation in the source, no consistent style, and no support for any runtime except SWF. Nevertheless, I've already successfully integrated the library with a larger application and it is functioning well in our beta release.This library is based upon the Flash Actionscript library that ionel-alexandru (Sourceforge username) of learn-math.info donated to the public domain. I make heavy use of Alex's object tree and MathML rendering logic (thanks Alex!). I've built upon OpenLaszlo's Drawview class from their SVN trunk and added support for rendering stand-alone MathML from a datasource as well as formulas placed inline with other text.Note that the full set of MathML has not yet been implemented (ex: no support for &lt;mtable&gt;) but here are some examples of supported formulas: &lt;dataset name=&quot;example1&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msqrt&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;45&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msqrt&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mroot linethickness=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt; &lt;msub&gt; &lt;mi&gt;log&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;5&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mroot&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dataset&gt;renders with the library as: &lt;dataset name=&quot;example2&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mo&gt; ( &lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mfrac linethickness=&quot;0&quot; color=&quot;#006699&quot;&gt; &lt;mi fontstyle=&quot;bold&quot;&gt; a + b +c &lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt; b &lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mfrac&gt; &lt;mo&gt; ) &lt;/mo&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mfrac linethickness=&quot;2&quot; fontstyle=&quot;italic&quot; &gt; &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi color=&quot;#00ff00&quot;&gt;3456&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt; &lt;mi&gt; a &lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi fontsize=&quot;8&quot;&gt; b + c + d&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mfrac&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;mfrac color=&quot;#ffff00&quot;&gt; &lt;mi&gt; c + d &lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt; d &lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mfrac&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dataset&gt;makes use of node-level styling to render asThe next one really shows off some of the fancy rendering capabilities: &lt;dataset name=&quot;example3&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt;msubsup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;56&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msubsup&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mtext fontstyle='italic'&gt;dx&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;msubsup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mi&gt;-&lt;![CDATA[&amp;infinity;]]&gt;&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mi&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&amp;infinity;]]&gt;&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/msubsup&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;x&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mtext fontstyle='italic'&gt;dx&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;munderover&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mn&gt;56&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/munderover&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;munderover&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&amp;infinity;]]&gt;&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/munderover&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;munderover&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/munderover&gt;&lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;munder&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;lim&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&lt;![CDATA[???]]&gt;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/munder&gt;&lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dataset&gt;This last example is demonstrating inline rendering with text: &lt;dataset name=&quot;myFormula&quot;&gt;&lt;![CDATA[This is an example of pseudo inline MathML:&lt;math&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;msup&gt; &lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mfrac&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;/mfrac&gt; &lt;/msup&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;/math&gt;How do you like them apples?]]&gt;&lt;/dataset&gt;All of the formulas above were displayed using the same MathML view using the datasets listed.
