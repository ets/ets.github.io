	Requests generated HTTP response code 500 and my error logs showed the unhelpful message "Premature end of script headers"
	I verified all permissions and even disabled / re-enabled cgi-bin support through Plesk which installs a test script under cgi-bin/test/test.cgi
	Even the test script failed to run. It also generated the message "Premature end of script headers: test.cgi"
	I eventually resolved the issue with two changes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The domain's root folder in /var/www/vhosts was not owned by the domain user. So I fixed that with a chown command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the Plesk control panel, I had to disable "Perl" support and enable "CGI" support to get my perl scripts with the ".pl" extension to run under cgi-bin&lt;/li&gt;

Our CI server (we use Jenkins) recently began bombing on several new tests that referenced java.awt packaged classes. The most common error in the stacktrace was "NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.awt.Color" and diving deeper we could see the root cause was "Can't connect to window server - not enough permissions".&lt;br /&gt;The interwebs all claimed setting &lt;code class="java plain"&gt;-Djava.awt.headless=true&lt;/code&gt; would resolve the issue but it did nothing for us. We set it as a Jenkins system parameter, in the launchctl job, in the bash_profile of the Jenkins user on the machine, and everywhere we could in the Jenkins job itself....to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Just before heading down the path of setting it programatically somewhere in our test stack - I noticed that our&amp;nbsp;maven-surefire-plugin was configured to use a threadCount of 10. On a hunch that&amp;nbsp;maven-surefire-plugin was not exporting my system properties to the new threads it spawned for the test run - I configured the plugin to set java.awt.headless with the following snip from our pom.xml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-surefire-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.5&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;excludes&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;exclude&amp;gt;**/TestInstanceBakerTest.java&amp;lt;/exclude&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;exclude&amp;gt;**/ExpectedAnswerGeneratorTest.java&amp;lt;/exclude&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;exclude&amp;gt;**/ClientNukeTest.java&amp;lt;/exclude&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;exclude&amp;gt;**/TestInstanceBank.java&amp;lt;/exclude&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;/excludes&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;parallel&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/parallel&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;threadCount&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/threadCount&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;systemPropertyVariables&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;java.awt.headless&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/java.awt.headless&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;log4j.configuration&amp;gt;${runtime.log4j.config}&amp;lt;/log4j.configuration&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;/systemPropertyVariables&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Problem solved.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Resolving 'Connection.close() has already been called.' when running long db-migration</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/08/23/resolving-connection.close-has-already-been-called.-when-running-long-db-migration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/08/23/resolving-connection.close-has-already-been-called.-when-running-long-db-migration/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

I encountered all types of strange behavior using Firefox 4 after my recent upgrade. The nastiest bug prevented me from accessing any windows other than the primary Firefox window. So all popups, while listed on the Windows menu, were completely inaccessible. I tried all the typical workarounds like disabling Addons and running in Safemode. But nothing permanently fixed the issue.&lt;p /&gt; Finally - I simply created a new Firefox profile and &lt;a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Transferring_data_to_a_new_profile_-_Firefox"&gt;transferred the bookmarks, passwords&lt;/a&gt;, etc... that I wanted to carryover. This resolved my issues completely. So before you throw away FF4 in frustration - try creating a clean profile. Probably not a bad idea anyway - I noticed FF3.0 cruft in my profile that I shed as part of this process.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enhanced mysqldump to support data cleansing compliance requirements by nullifying specific fields</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/04/08/enhanced-mysqldump-to-support-data-cleansing-compliance-requirements-by-nullifying-specific-fields/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/04/08/enhanced-mysqldump-to-support-data-cleansing-compliance-requirements-by-nullifying-specific-fields/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

Currently - my favorite methods of testing web applications for Internet Explorer compatibility at minimal expenditure of time, money, and pain are:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/"&gt;Virtualbox&lt;/a&gt; installations &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;PROS: Great performance and virtually zero hassle after initial setup&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CONS: These are not easily shared, so every developer needs his own virtual machine which needs to be individually licensed&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gogrid.com/"&gt;GoGrid&lt;/a&gt; on-demand servers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;PROS: Instances can be shared by multiple developers so you only need to configure each virtual machine environment once. MS Windows Licensing is built into the on-demand pricing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CONS: Performance is adequate, but screen refreshes are slow enough to be distracting. It takes about 15 minutes to spin an instance up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; With either method of obtaining a virtual machine, you'll have to decide how to handle testing for all the permutations you need to support. The "brute force" method is to create a virtual machine for each permutation of OS, Browser, Flash Player, etc...&amp;nbsp; There are some other options though:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/WEB-Design/Web-Design-related/Expression-Web-SuperPreview.shtml"&gt;Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview&lt;/a&gt; for Windows Internet Explorer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;can be used to test basic IE6 support on a machine with a more recent version installed - but not a terribly accurate emulator&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer 8 with Developer Tools installed &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;using "Compatibility" mode to emulate IE7 works well enough to debug javascript&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Solution for Firefox 4 installation failure on Mac OS X due to 'libsmime3.dylib is in use' error</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/03/28/solution-for-firefox-4-installation-failure-on-mac-os-x-due-to-libsmime3.dylib-is-in-use-error/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2011/03/28/solution-for-firefox-4-installation-failure-on-mac-os-x-due-to-libsmime3.dylib-is-in-use-error/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

I installed on a Mac OS X server with Snow Leopard, but this applies to any Tomcat 6 installation.

Rather than disabling the Tomcat Security Manager as a workaround, I recommend setting the applicable properties through system properties at startup.

I was fond of the stack &lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/a&gt; offered when I developed on Windows and lazily continued used &lt;a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html"&gt;XAMPP/MAMP&lt;/a&gt; once I moved to a Mac OS X based workstation. Unfortunately, the latest releases of MAMP have attempted to restrict the utility of the stack in an effort to raise revenue through a less restricted "Pro" version. Developers on Snow Leopard are much better off moving to standalone installations of everything MAMP offers.There are many ways to install PHP, MySQL, Apache, and phpMyAdmin - all with a list of pros/cons. Without debating the merits, here's what I did to replace MAMP:&lt;h2&gt;1. Dump your MAMP Mysql databases and save them for import into your standalone MySQL install&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqldump --all-databases &amp;gt; ~/old-mysql-data.sql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Install a more recent copy of MySQL server than the one delivered with Snow Leopard&lt;/h2&gt;I already had &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/"&gt;macports&lt;/a&gt; installed, so the choice here was easy. The following command installs the mysql binaries under /opt/local/bin/&lt;code&gt;port install mysql5 mysql5-server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Import your data into your new MySQL database&lt;/h2&gt;First, be certain to shutdown all the MAMP servers (MySQL, Apache, etc...) - then start your new standalone MySQL&lt;code&gt;sudo /opt/local/bin/mysqld_safe5 &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;Finally, run the following:&lt;code&gt;mysql &lt;h2&gt;4. Install phpMyAdmin on the SL delivered Apache installation&lt;/h2&gt;Install it fresh, or just copy your MAMP installation to ~/Sites where it will be available under http://localhost/~your-username/&lt;h2&gt;5. Enable PHP5 on the SL delivered Apache installation&lt;/h2&gt;Open /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and enable the line: "#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so" by removing the pound. Then in the Mac System Pref -&amp;gt; Sharing, turn on (or if it was already on, turn off/on) Web Sharing. If you need to move any vhost or SSL config directives from MAMP to the SL Apache install, you'll make those changes to files in /etc/apache2/extra/&lt;h2&gt;6. Optional - Configure PHP by creating a php.ini under /etc&lt;/h2&gt;I'm content to use the PHP installation already delivered by SL, but there is no default php.ini - simply create one under /etc and it'll be read automatically.You can now remove the MAMP training wheels and proceed developing with full standalone versions of your stack - happy trails.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Support chroot for SCP connections on CentOS 5.5</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2010/11/02/support-chroot-for-scp-connections-on-centos-5.5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2010/11/02/support-chroot-for-scp-connections-on-centos-5.5/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.gnucash.org/"&gt;GnuCash&lt;/a&gt; served me well while I was running Ubuntu as my primary desktop but since moving to a Mac Pro I've been disappointed in the performance and non-native nature of the GnuCash Mac port. I decided to migrate to &lt;a href="http://moneydance.com/"&gt;MoneyDance&lt;/a&gt; and was quickly dismayed to discover GnuCash's poor support for standards based exporting.This GnuCash wiki-entry &lt;a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_export_data.3F"&gt;describes a few convoluted approaches to data export&lt;/a&gt; but the items it references are hopelessly outdated and generally do not function for the latest stable release - reason enough to ditch GnuCash.MoneyDance hadn't solved the problem on their end either but their wiki does &lt;a href="http://moneydance.com/trac/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#CanIimportmyGnuCashdata"&gt;reference a Perl script that converts the deprecated GnuCash Postgre storage format into a MoneyDance XML file&lt;/a&gt;. Since I knew that the development release of GnuCash supports a SQLite storage format I decided to see if I could update Sid Reed's aforementioned script for this new SQLite container.I'm no Perl Monger, but &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/208/"&gt;I do know regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;. My updated script worked well for me and seamlessly converted several years of GnuCash data. Please read the pre-requisites section in the header of this&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ericsimmerman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GnuCash-MoneyDance-Importer.zip"&gt;GnuCash to MoneyDance Migration Script&lt;/a&gt; before attempting to run it. In addition to the linked zip archive, &lt;a href="http://github.com/ets/MoneyDance-GnuCash-Importer"&gt;this script is also available on github&lt;/a&gt;.

Environment properties weren't available to me on my Mac server for some reason. The solution I eventually adopted was the one used in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Cobertura+Plugin"&gt;Cobertura Plugin docs here&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been evaluating the opensource &lt;a href="http://www.cerberusweb.com/"&gt;Cerberus Helpdesk&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to the closed source Kayako esupport. I like how Cerberus separates the creation of multiple knowledgebases that can then be published across multiple community portals. Instead of one comprehensive knowledgebase presented to all customers, I can use Cerberus to present product specific knowledgebases. It's a nice concept that should make it much easier for a customer to locate support information and thereby reduce the number of support tickets generated.Customizing the public facing portals for my Cerberus installation was straightforward. The admin console provided a good degree of flexibility, but I wanted a bit more so I manually modified usermeet.core/templates/portal/sc/module/index.tpl in order to insert analytics scripts and some more detailed customization. That was easy, but my next mod proved more difficult. By default, Cerberus displays 10 articles on each page of search results and I wanted to increase that count to 20. Cerberus' architecture actually makes it a bit tricky to determine the control flow used by the community portals but I eventually traced the article retrieval flow to the DAO_KbArticle class in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/App.php and changed the default limit on the search method from 10 to 20. The limit is set as a hardcoded constant in the method signature....yuck. After the change, 20 articles were pulled from the database on each request, but there were still only 10 displayed in the portal.It took a lot of searching to find the missing piece and it was yet another hardcoded value in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/sc/kb.php where $view-&amp;gt;renderLimit was set to 10. Changing this gave me the desired row count on the portal.The Cerberus team has put together a nice product but given that one of its core competitive features is its opensource nature, I'd like to see the codebase refactored to better facilitate this type of customization. Values like these limits could easily be defined in framework.config.php instead of scattering hardcoded settings across multiple files. That said, at least I had to option to manipulate the software - something I can't do with Kayako's offering.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Connecting to Netscreen Series (NetScreen-5) VPN with Mac OS X (Snow Leopard)</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2010/03/05/connecting-to-netscreen-series-netscreen-5-vpn-with-mac-os-x-snow-leopard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2010/03/05/connecting-to-netscreen-series-netscreen-5-vpn-with-mac-os-x-snow-leopard/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

After a clean Snow Leopard install on a new machine, I fired up a fresh Galileo Eclipse and pointed it at a copy of my old workspace.&amp;nbsp; I first encountered and resolved the missing Mac OS X JRE issue described in my last post, only to then find that my existing subversion repositories were inaccessible in the new Eclipse install. I hopefully added "-clean" as the first parameter of my eclipse.ini file and restarted but the situation remained unchanged.

I recently encountered an issue where I was unable to add a JVM to my Eclipse install on Snow Leopard. There was no MacOS X VM option under Installed JREs -&amp;gt; Add and attempting to use the Standard VM resulted in an error. After digging around in Eclipse bug reports, I discovered this is a known issue with the Cocoa build of Galileo with PDT pre-installed.&amp;nbsp; The easy fix is to install Eclipse without PDT (just install the Eclipse IDE for Java - Cocoa 64 bit) and add PDT plugin later. When you take this route, the MacOS X VM will be configured automagically.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Copy/Paste clipboard broken on Snow Leopard</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/12/19/copy/paste-clipboard-broken-on-snow-leopard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/12/19/copy/paste-clipboard-broken-on-snow-leopard/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
After a recent Apple update, copy and paste quit functioning on my Snow Leopard install. After a number of red herrings, I eventually traced the issue to &lt;a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt; and noticed that synergyc constantly emptied my clipboard immediately after any copy operation. I was running synergy 1.3.1 at the time which was released back in 2006 - I was hopeful that the latest release of the Synergy fork &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/"&gt;Synergy Plus&lt;/a&gt; might provide a quick solution.An install of synergy-plus 1.3.4 Darwin binary did not resolve the issue and a build of the latest from subversion (r252) would not run for me (separate issue - synergyc unable to resolve server address).I happened upon &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/detail?id=67#c85"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; in my search for an answer and based on comments there decided to build revision 242 for my Mac client and run 252 on my Ubuntu server. Happy to report it resolved my issues.One note - I was thrown for a bit when my first Xcode build resulted in 14 compile time errors. Turns out it was necessary for me to build for i386 as the 64-bit build would not compile for me.UPDATE: After a couple weeks use, I found the synergy-plus binary to be rather buggy and went in search of a solution. MacPorts supports a patched build of synergy 1.3.1 for Snow Leopard and so far it is working beautifully. Assuming you have ports installed, the following will install the tried and true synergy.&lt;blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"&gt;port clean synergy ; port install synergy +universal&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Subversion, Jira, Sonar, Hudson &amp; Fisheye on Mac OSX Server with Snow Leopard</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/11/06/subversion-jira-sonar-hudson-fisheye-on-mac-osx-server-with-snow-leopard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/11/06/subversion-jira-sonar-hudson-fisheye-on-mac-osx-server-with-snow-leopard/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
Here are some notes from the field on setting up all these development services to play nice on Mac OS X Server 10.6:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/server/subversionwithxcode3.html"&gt;this excellent writeup from Apple&lt;/a&gt; to get Subversion setup as a webservice. Note the comment about how the DAV setting can revert to DAV no and need correction. I've found that it sometimes reverts to "DAV On" and this will break your subversion service...it must always be set to DAV svn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure Jira using Server Admin's "Sites" panel for configuring the Web service. Under Sites-&amp;gt;Proxy configure an ajp worker to talk to your Jira instance. I installed jira on its own context /jira as opposed to root and therefore set the worker URL path as well as the Proxy Path to /jira&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For running under the same hostname/virtual host any additional balancer groups will need to be configured manually. I was able to configure an ajp balancer for sonar but had to use a http balancer for hudson. Avoid using 8443 for your ports for any customer services as Apple's iCal is configured for this one by default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing python-mysql connector MySQLdb after Snow Leopard upgrade</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/10/23/installing-python-mysql-connector-mysqldb-after-snow-leopard-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/10/23/installing-python-mysql-connector-mysqldb-after-snow-leopard-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
After upgrading to Snow Leopard and all its 64-bit goodness, I discovered that the upgrade to python 2.6.1 64-bit understandably broke my python-mysql connector which was previously compiled against my 32-bit installation of XAMPP with MySQL. I tried several different paths to make the new python play nice with the existing XAMPP installation. Here's the one that worked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insure that you have the MySQL include directory needed for compilation against the XAMPP MySQL binary you are running. I'm running a 5.0.x build of MySQL and to get the proper include dir I simply downloaded the &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg"&gt;32-bit DMG for Mac from here&lt;/a&gt;. After installation, I simply copied the include dir to my xampp installation.&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cp -R /usr/local/mysql/include /Applications/xampp/xamppfiles/&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now the xampp version of mysql_config will point to your newly installed include dir, so you are ready to compile against it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you don't already have it, grab the python-mysql connector source. I'm using MySQL-python-1.2.3c1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell your 64-bit python to always run in 32-bit mode &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cd into the MySQL-python source directory and build it for 32-bit mode&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386' python setup.py build&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;install it &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386' python setup.py install&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exit the source directory "cd ~" and test your new install &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;pythonPython 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jul 7 2009, 23:51:51)[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwinType &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;credits&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;license&amp;quot; for more information.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import MySQLdb&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You're welcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Resolving a 'CA key usage check failed: keyCertSign bit is not set' error in Tomcat</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/10/22/resolving-a-ca-key-usage-check-failed-keycertsign-bit-is-not-set-error-in-tomcat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/10/22/resolving-a-ca-key-usage-check-failed-keycertsign-bit-is-not-set-error-in-tomcat/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
After installing a new GoDaddy SSL certificate in Tomcat 5.5.x my web browsers were able to properly negotiate SSL connections, but when back-end code attempted (specifically when CAS attempted to validate a ticket through Cas20ServiceTicketValidator) to connect using SSL the "CA key usage check failed: keyCertSign bit is not set" error was being thrown. &lt;p /&gt;My tomcat server is fronted by Apache2 and Apache handles SSL negotiation. I discovered that I had improperly installed the intermediate certificate for GoDaddy and while modern browsers just ignored the resulting misconfiguration, Java was complaining.&lt;p /&gt;I had set the SSLCertificateChainFile directive to point to the "cert-chain.crt" file. The mistake is understandable given the near identical naming of the directive and the file...but alas that intuitive connection is erroneous. The directive instead needs to point to the gd_intermediate.crt file that GoDaddy also provides. Here's what my correct config looks like on RHEL5: &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/gd_intermediate.crt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Compiling mod_caucho on RHEL 5.3</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/09/14/compiling-mod_caucho-on-rhel-5.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/09/14/compiling-mod_caucho-on-rhel-5.3/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

After installing the latest Mac OSX upgrade Skype began giving me trouble. I found &lt;a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=409531"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; in Skype's forums which attests to the issue. Downgrading to 2.7.0 is suggested as a solution there, but it did not work for me. The downgraded version still locked-up and refused to quit without a force. However, I kept 2.7.0.330 installed and convinced OS X to install &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/rosetta/"&gt;Rosetta&lt;/a&gt; (it prompted me for the install automatically when I attempted to launch Photoshop). After the Rosetta install and reboot, Skype 2.7.0.330 functioned properly for a few sessions and then fell down taking the whole kernel with it via the black screen of death. I've since upgraded to 2.8.0.659 which doesn't seem to crash but just stops working occasionally. The symptom exhibited is that messages stay in the "pending..." state and are simply never delivered.&lt;p /&gt;UPDATE: I've resolved my issues by explicitly opening the Skype inbound port (the default is 65269 and it's configurable under Preferences -&amp;gt; Advanced) in my firewall. This was not needed until I upgraded to Snow Leopard but apparently is now required to keep Skype functioning properly. I maintain a custom firewall configuration using /sbin/ipfw and I added the following line to /etc/rc.firewall to open the Skype inbound port.&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;add 3020 allow log tcp from any to any 65269 in&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saving that and restarting ipfw Skype is functioning as expected.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Improving VirtualBox performance</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/08/14/improving-virtualbox-performance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/08/14/improving-virtualbox-performance/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

Here's a snip of my initial manager bean config:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;clientManager&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&amp;quot;accessDecisionManager&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:protect method=&amp;quot;get&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:protect method=&amp;quot;save&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/sec:intercept-methods&amp;gt; &amp;lt;constructor-arg ref=&amp;quot;clientDao&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;mutableAclService&amp;quot; ref=&amp;quot;aclService&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With this configuration, my unit tests verified that the method-level authorization was working as expected. Next, I applied some declarative transaction management to the same manager:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;aop:config&amp;gt; &amp;lt;aop:advisor id=&amp;quot;managerTx&amp;quot; advice-ref=&amp;quot;txAdvice&amp;quot; pointcut=&amp;quot;execution(* *..service.*Manager.*(..))&amp;quot; order=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aop:config&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tx:advice id=&amp;quot;txAdvice&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tx:attributes&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tx:method name=&amp;quot;get*&amp;quot; read-only=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tx:method name=&amp;quot;save*&amp;quot; rollback-for=&amp;quot;DuplicateNameException,UserExistsException&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tx:method name=&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tx:attributes&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tx:advice&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After adding this transaction advice, my unit tests failed method-level authorization checks. I never traced the issue to its absolute root cause, but based upon some open tickets against Spring I believe the error was due to a "double-proxy" type issue. The short story is that proxies are final, and Spring can't proxy a proxy...&lt;p /&gt;Regardless of the root cause, I found a reasonable workaround was to revert to one of the "old" (more verbose) methods of transaction demarcation. Here's what my final working configuration looks like:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;baseTransactionProxy&amp;quot; abstract=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;transactionManager&amp;quot; ref=&amp;quot;transactionManager&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;transactionAttributes&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;props&amp;gt; &amp;lt;prop key=&amp;quot;get*&amp;quot;&amp;gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly&amp;lt;/prop&amp;gt; &amp;lt;prop key=&amp;quot;save*&amp;quot;&amp;gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,-DuplicateNameException,-UserExistsException&amp;lt;/prop&amp;gt; &amp;lt;prop key=&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&amp;gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&amp;lt;/prop&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/props&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;clientManager&amp;quot; parent=&amp;quot;baseTransactionProxy&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;target&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&amp;quot;accessDecisionManager&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:protect method=&amp;quot;get&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sec:protect method=&amp;quot;save&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/sec:intercept-methods&amp;gt; &amp;lt;constructor-arg ref=&amp;quot;clientDao&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;mutableAclService&amp;quot; ref=&amp;quot;aclService&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By leveraging the TransactionProxyFactoryBean directly instead of relying upon the tx:advice and aop:config tags, I was able to wrap my Spring ACL secured methods with declarative transactions.

Dear US Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;br /&gt;CC: everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the morning of June 27th 2009, electrical power to my household was briefly disrupted around 3:30am by several breaks in service over a period of about 20 seconds. Approximately 5 minutes after the disruption, I noticed thick black smoke billowing from a room housing several electronic devices. I was able to enter the room and identify the source of the smoke as the burning plastic of my Belkin "Conceal" Surge Protector. I was thankfully able to quickly terminate power to the device and remove the smoldering plastic from my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Resolve foreign key constraint error/conflict with DBUnit CLEAN_INSERT operation (MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException)</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/06/17/resolve-foreign-key-constraint-error/conflict-with-dbunit-clean_insert-operation-mysqlintegrityconstraintviolationexception/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/06/17/resolve-foreign-key-constraint-error/conflict-with-dbunit-clean_insert-operation-mysqlintegrityconstraintviolationexception/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If DBUnit starts throwing MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException while performing a CLEAN_INSERT you can lose quite a bit of sleep attempting to resolve it or you can cheat and get back to work. The shortcut is to simply disable constraints for the INSERT operation by disabling constraints for DBUnit altogether. You can do that by adding sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 to your JDBC connection string to MySQL. I use maven and in pom.xml my configuration for the dbunit plugin looks like this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using jQuery and Scriptaculous/prototype together</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/06/01/using-jquery-and-scriptaculous/prototype-together/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/06/01/using-jquery-and-scriptaculous/prototype-together/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

PHP and Ruby syntax are far enough apart that I was loathe to attempt a port of some working PHP scripts in my arsenal, but I needed to call said scripts from a relatively complex Ruby program. Fast &amp;amp; dirty integration of this type is generally performed using a system call, but unlike most things Ruby I didn't find the Ruby way in this case to be all that intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;The %x technique for the system call made it easy to read the output of my PHP program into a variable in the calling script. The real trick was finding the correct syntax for passing a parameter to the %x call as shown below.&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my studies grasshopper:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;avariableparameter = &amp;quot;--o ipso -v lorem&amp;quot;result = %x[php /path/to/script.php &amp;quot;#{avariableparameter}&amp;quot;]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fix for KeePassX window positioning off screen after changing monitors</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/04/06/fix-for-keepassx-window-positioning-off-screen-after-changing-monitors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/04/06/fix-for-keepassx-window-positioning-off-screen-after-changing-monitors/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

DHTML didn't function normally, dropdown menus were inaccessible, flash interactions were also hit-or-miss...&lt;p /&gt;At first I blamed Firefox since Safari exhibited no such issues, but after a bit of trial and error I decided to compile Synergy server from source on my Ubuntu box.

Using Spring MVC's checkboxes (or radiobuttons) tag to render form inputs for an enum property is easy and clean...once you know how. After a little gnashing of teeth, due to the fact that I needed a specific display order for all options, I found the following solution:&lt;p /&gt;Here's the tag in my jsp&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;form:checkboxes itemValue=&amp;quot;value&amp;quot; itemLabel=&amp;quot;label&amp;quot; path=&amp;quot;user.degrees&amp;quot; items=&amp;quot;${degreeLabels }&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the way I populated my model map to retain ordering. (I placed this code in my FormController's referenceData method)&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List labelValues = new ArrayList&amp;lt;LabelValue&amp;gt;(); for (Degree d : Degree.values()) { labelValues.add(new LabelValue(d.name(), d.name())); } Map model = new HashMap(); model.put(&amp;quot;degreeLabels&amp;quot;, labelValues);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;FYI, I ripped the LabelValue class used above from Matt Riable's excellent Appfuse project. The constructor takes two arguments which are mapped to the properties "value" and "label" and these properties have the typical pojo getters and setters.&lt;br /&gt;You can see from the path on my tag that degrees is a property on my User object...which is the target of my form. Here's what that looks like...I threw in my Hibernate annotations for the curious:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;private Set&amp;lt;Degree&amp;gt; degrees = new HashSet&amp;lt;Degree&amp;gt;(); @CollectionOfElements @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) public Set&amp;lt;Degree&amp;gt; getDegrees() { return degrees; } public void setDegrees(Set&amp;lt;Degree&amp;gt; degrees) { this.degrees = degrees; }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's probably obvious, but here's what the Degree enum looks like:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public enum Degree { BA,BS,BN,BSW,MA,MS,MBA,MSN,MSW,MD,JD,PhD,PharmD,PsyD,Other;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hibernate Annotations - IdentifierGenerationException: attempted to assign id from null one-to-one property</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/02/18/hibernate-annotations-identifiergenerationexception-attempted-to-assign-id-from-null-one-to-one-property/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2009/02/18/hibernate-annotations-identifiergenerationexception-attempted-to-assign-id-from-null-one-to-one-property/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

&lt;a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/"&gt;TurboTax Online&lt;/a&gt;'s investment sale (stock, mutual fund, etc sales for capital gains) entry screen is a nice example of braindead design. Although the application provides a "bulk-entry spreadsheet-like interface", there's no import function available. So despite having all of my data in a nice spreadsheet (exported from the MS Money capital gains report) I was still faced with the prospect of manually entering each field from dozens of transactions. Worse still, the interface limits your access to seven rows/transactions per page.&lt;p /&gt;Applescript to the rescue! It's an ugly solution, but it saved me a ton of time and helped avoid any manual entry typos:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use your spreadsheet program to arrange your transaction data into columns matching those in TurboTax's interface. You should have five columns. Insure that the dates are formatted as mm/dd/yy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the data into your favorite text editor as tab-delimited text (I used the excellent TextMate)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use search and replace to convert all the tabs into &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab &amp;amp; &amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use search and replace to insert the following at the beginning of every line &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;keystroke &amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use search and replace to insert the following at the end of every line &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now each line should look something like this&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;keystroke &amp;quot;ACME Stock&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab &amp;amp; &amp;quot;11/10/08&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab &amp;amp; &amp;quot;100.12&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab &amp;amp; &amp;quot;1/12/05&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab &amp;amp; &amp;quot;584.12&amp;quot; &amp;amp; tab&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paste the following script into the Script Editor application on your Mac&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;tell application &amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot; tell process &amp;quot;Firefox&amp;quot;--Clearly replace Firefox above if you are using a different browser set frontmost to true--Transactions go here end tellend tell&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut 7 lines at a time from your text editor, paste them into the Script Editor and click "Run"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The script will populate the TurboTax screen with your data.

So my upgrade to Verizon FiOS included swapping my Linksys WRT54G access point for the Verizon branded ActionTec device that came with the FiOS install. This swap wasn't strictly necessary, but the ActionTec doubles as both the router and access point so I decided I might as well make use of the wireless capabilities since I have to keep it plugged in either way.The only problem I encountered was that my Linksys WRT54G bridge couldn't play nice with the ActionTec. Through trial and error I found that setting both devices to encrypt using WPA2-PSK using AES only (not the default TKIP+AES) resolved my issues.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Removing duplicate music files with different names from a large directory free</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2008/10/28/removing-duplicate-music-files-with-different-names-from-a-large-directory-free/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2008/10/28/removing-duplicate-music-files-with-different-names-from-a-large-directory-free/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;
During a recent Mac migration, I hosed my iTunes library and unintentionally generated hundreds of duplicate songs (the actual media files). The problem was exacerbated by the fact that a numeric was generally appended to the duplicate filenames so that I had directories full of files like the following:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/artist/album/song.mp3/artist/album/song 1.mp3/artist/album/song 2.mp3&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Apple wasn't doing me any favors by injecting a space in the new names either....what a mess!&lt;p&gt;I stole a few ideas from &lt;a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-97701.html"&gt;this excellent forum thread&lt;/a&gt; and cobbled together a script to remove files based on exact byte counts and md5sum signatures.

I just spent a morning attempting to fix a &lt;a href="http://www.jroller.com/agileanswers/entry/mounting_an_ubuntu_nfs_share"&gt;NFS mounting configuration&lt;/a&gt; that had been working flawlessly for over 6 months. My daemon log was showing this:&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;nfssvc: writing fds to kernel failed: errno 98 (Address already in use)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much angst, I finally stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2007/01/msg00343.html"&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned a conflict between avahi-daemon and NFSd.

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to announce that my company (&lt;a href="http://www.tempeststrings.com"&gt;Tempest Strings Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;) has sponsored my development and release of a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/"&gt;MathML&lt;/a&gt; library for &lt;a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/"&gt;OpenLaszlo&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be working through the OpenLaszlo contributor process, but imagine that it could take a considerable amount of time before you see this work in their repository since I've not yet made any effort to adhere to any coding guidelines. There is very little documentation in the source, no consistent style, and no support for any runtime except SWF. Nevertheless, I've already successfully integrated the library with a larger application and it is functioning well in our beta release.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spring JMS Remoting support for async calls and methods with void return types</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2008/05/28/spring-jms-remoting-support-for-async-calls-and-methods-with-void-return-types/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2008/05/28/spring-jms-remoting-support-for-async-calls-and-methods-with-void-return-types/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

In the 1.0.4 release, there is no indicator of which post you are currently viewing within a threaded tree of posts. Here's my hack to implement such an indicator.&lt;p /&gt;Under your chosen template directory (ex: components/com_fireboard/templates/default), edit the thread.php file. Look for the TR with class="fb_threadview_row" and modify it like so:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;tr class=&amp;quot;fb_threadview_row&amp;quot; &amp;lt;? if($leaf-&amp;gt;id == (int)$id){ echo &amp;quot;style='background-color:yellow'&amp;quot;; } ?&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You can use any background-color value you desire. I used "yellow" in the above example.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Java webbrowser plugin for AMD64 Ubuntu</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2007/10/29/java-webbrowser-plugin-for-amd64-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2007/10/29/java-webbrowser-plugin-for-amd64-ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'&gt;

It can be tough making NFS play nice amongst different distros and firewalls. I'm sharing my Eclipse workspace on my Ubuntu (Debian) desktop with my CentOS (Redhat Enterprise) server. (That's not a mistake, my server is actually my NFS client in this scenario. You could easily swap these roles if you wish)&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;DEBIAN:I used port numbers and config instructions at http://wiki.debian.org/?SecuringNFSFollow those instructions exactly and you'll have a NFS server configuration that uses static ports (instead of random assignements)REDHAT:1. Create the file &amp;quot;/etc/sysconfig/nfs&amp;quot; and add the following contents:STATD_PORT=32765STATD_OUTGOING_PORT=32766LOCKD_TCPPORT=32768LOCKD_UDPPORT=32768MOUNTD_PORT=327672. (Probably not necessary for most, but here for completeness) Append the following to the file &amp;quot;/etc/services&amp;quot;:rquotad 32769/tcp # rpc.rquotad tcp portrquotad 32769/udp # rpc.rquotad udp port3. Restart the nfslock service:/etc/init.d/nfslock restart4. Run /usr/sbin/rpcinfo -p and make sure all the ports above have changed and match their ubuntu numbers. (/usr/bin/rpcinfo on ubuntu)5. I run firestarter on Ubuntu which is exporting my NFS share. I added the following policy rules for inbound traffic:Allow 32767 (from my client machine's IP)Allow 2049 (from my client machine's IP)Allow 111 (from my client machine's IP)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Assuming you allow all outbound traffic on your client (I recommend this excellent iptables config file &lt;a href="http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/scripts/rc.firewall_023.txt"&gt;rc.firewall_023.txt&lt;/a&gt;), you should now be able to mount the NFS share on the Redhat box.&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Migrated from JRoller</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2006/01/01/migrated-from-jroller/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2006/01/01/migrated-from-jroller/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Entries prior to October 2007 are only available on &lt;a href="http://jroller.com/agileanswers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;my original Agile Answers blog hosted at JRoller here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
