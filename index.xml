Among the myriad principles that guide data quality efforts, one principle merits special attention: the separation of data transformation from the application of data quality checks. This isn’t just an operational distinction; it’s a philosophical approach that amplifies the potential of both procedures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Invalid set theory ruined my day</title><link>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2023/05/20/invalid-set-theory-ruined-my-day/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Eric Simmerman</author><guid>https://www.ericsimmerman.com/blog/2023/05/20/invalid-set-theory-ruined-my-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>So why was the union of two Datasets formed from the same case class failing?

The Bastion only exposes port 22 for SSH and I wanted to restrict access to a whitelist of authorized IP addresses rather than leave port 22 open to the internet. Further - I wanted to restrict 443 and 80 inbound to the development environment so that only authorized users/developers could access the pre-release builds deployed there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
