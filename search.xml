      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You cannot use GRANT ALL for any user on an Amazon AWS RDS instance of Mysql/Maria (Aurora Mysql). When you use the GRANT ALL statement you are also attempting to provide Global Super Permissions such as File and this is not allowed on AWS RDS.</p>
<p>So you need to break out the permissions instead of using GRANT ALL. As of this writing, the most you can grant are:</p>
<p>SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EVENT, TRIGGER </p>
<p>Using them in a statement such as:</p>
<p>GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EVENT, TRIGGER ON my_database . * TO ‘my_user‘@’localhost’;</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Setting up a Bastion host on AWS]]></title>
      <url>/2017/05/18/2017-05-01-setting-up-bastion-host-aws/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When setting up my latest development environment at AWS, I wanted to deploy all EC2 services on a private VPC and simply route all traffic to them through a Bastion host (aka jump host). AWS maintains a an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="external">excellent CloudFormation quickstart guide &amp; template here</a> and it’s what I used to get started. After completing that guide I put a new entry for the Bastion host in my ssh config like so:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Host bastion</div><div class="line">  Hostname ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com</div><div class="line">  User ec2-user</div><div class="line">  IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/ssh-key.pem</div><div class="line">  AddKeysToAgent yes</div><div class="line">  UseKeychain yes</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Those last two lines are optional - but I like to <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.2" target="_blank" rel="external">leverage the Keychain on my MacBookPro</a> for storing keys and their respective passphrases. Accepting the host key into your known_hosts file can avoid some pain going forward, so I recommend connecting directly to the bastion before continuing.</p>
<p>To test my setup, I launched a EC2 instance in my private VPC and configured it in my ssh config like so:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Host 10.100.*.*</div><div class="line">  ProxyCommand ssh ec2-user@bastion -W %h:%p  </div><div class="line">  User ec2-user</div><div class="line">  IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/ssh-key.pem</div><div class="line">  AddKeysToAgent yes</div><div class="line">  UseKeychain yes</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The magic happens on the second line with the ProxyCommand instructing SSH to jump through Bastion to route to any of the private IP addresses used in my development environment VPC. Unfortunately, my first attempt to connect failed. I poked around in the Bastion’s SSHD config and realized that the CloudFront template was so hardened that it wasn’t going to support the transparent sessions I wanted. I needed to modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following just below the PAM section:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">PermitOpen any</div><div class="line">AllowTCPForwarding yes</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>After making the change be certain to restart the sshd service on Bastion.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of the CloudFormation design is that it uses an AutoScaling group to automatically tear down unresponsive Bastions and spin up replacements - even adapting to availability zone issues. When that happens the replacement Bastion will be configured with template defaults, so to ensure my sshd_config change would survive a failover, I copied the LaunchConfig and edited the user data to include the following:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">perl -pi -0 -w -e &apos;s/UsePAM yes/UsePam yes\n\n# Added by ets to support transparent pass through\nPermitOpen any\nAllowTCPForwarding yes/&apos; sshd_config</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Then I replaced the currently configured LaunchConfig on my AutoScaling group with my copy.</p>
<p>Now simply asking SSH to connect to my new services in the private VPC worked transparently!<br>To make session more efficient using this type of proxy, I added the following to my Bastion host entry in ssh config:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p</div><div class="line">ControlMaster auto</div><div class="line">ControlPersist 10m</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>If you’re an <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">ansible</a> fan like me, you can take advantage of that same technique with a change to ansible.cfg:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=30m</div><div class="line">control_path = ~/.ssh/ansible-%%r@%%h:%%p</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>If you’re curious how to further protect your Bastion host with a whitelist for port 22 while also supporting users who are behind dynamic IPs then you’ll want to <a href="/2017/05/16/2017-05-16-aws-lambda-firewall/">check out my aws-lambda-firewall project</a>.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Knock first firewall for AWS Security Groups]]></title>
      <url>/2017/05/16/2017-05-16-aws-lambda-firewall/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="./2017-05-01-setting-up-bastion-host-aws.html">setup a Bastion host</a> to secure a development environment on AWS. The Bastion only exposes port 22 for SSH and I wanted to restrict access to a whitelist of authorized IP addresses rather than leave port 22 open to the internet. Further - I wanted to restrict 443 and 80 inbound to the development environment so that only authorized users/developers could access the pre-release builds deployed there.</p>
<p>But I and others on my team switch IP addresses often and don’t want to hassle with manual manipulation of AWS Security Groups each time I move networks in meatspace. So I threw together <a href="https://github.com/ets/aws-lambda-firewall" target="_blank" rel="external">a “knock for access” firewall using API Gateway &amp; lambda</a> to conveniently add and expire authorized IP addresses on the applicable Security Groups. Enjoy!</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Social Tables Retrospective]]></title>
      <url>/2017/01/23/2017-01-23-Social-Tables-Retrospective/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last post was over a year and a half ago - just after I joined an interesting <a href="https://www.bvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bessemer Ventures</a> backed firm in the Hospitality sector called <a href="https://www.socialtables.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Social Tables</a>.<br>My role here has been 95% people / 5% tech and always intense. I’m retroactively posting some of the internal content I circulated as the technology leader at Social Tables - mostly high-level explanations of what my team was up to at the time.</p>
<p><img style="width: 650px;" src="/images/social-tables-team.jpeg"></p>
<p>It’s been a fun ride with unique challenges and <a href="https://healthprize.com/about-us/press-releases/healthprize-technologies-announces-new-chief-technology-officer/" target="_blank" rel="external">as I move on to my next post</a>, I wanted to capture a few takeaways for posterity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid greenfield rewrites of established applications.</strong> Specifics may warrant a true rewrite - but recognize the extreme risk to all involved if that’s the selected path. While I certainly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="external">agree with what Joel says about this here</a>, I’ll add one more point of support - that a rewrite is a fight on two fronts. It’s up against the formidable foes of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Amazing/dp/0399144463" target="_blank" rel="external">customer adoption of a new thing</a> and the golden project phenomenon - where a golden (too big to fail) project’s scope continually increases without bound.</li>
<li><strong>Hire for squads and fire quickly on non-fit.</strong> My worst HR calls at Social Tables involved attempts to reassign an employee to a different team in an attempt to establish fit. This is especially difficult where the employee in question was inherited as opposed to hired under my watch. There’s a strong desire to give the inherited employee multiple chances to demonstrate fit. Don’t do it - if the employee is not a good enough for the first team she joins (or is assigned to) then do her and the rest of the team a favor - cut her loose with dignity. Such an evaluation might rightly not be considered fair - c’est la vie.</li>
<li><strong>Adopt 2-3 cutting-edge technologies, but no more.</strong> This worked really well for us - especially on the recruiting tip. Our best hires came through our broadcast of niche (at the time) tech such as WebGL, React, and RethinkDB. But it’s a double-edged sword. Our worst tech adoption failures came from naive pushes into Falcor, Dynamo, and Horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Onward &amp; Upward!</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted the following on an internal blog at Social Tables in an attempt to explain a bit about what our Software Engineering group was up to at the time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today we’re going to talk briefly about query tuning - a black art in the craft of software engineering that <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=582095.582099" target="_blank" rel="external">predates the Internet</a> but is still incredibly relevant. I don’t mean relevant in the “you should really pay attention to national politics” sense.  I mean relevant as in “this can (when done poorly) wreck your whole day.”</p>
<h2 id="What’s-query-tuning"><a href="#What’s-query-tuning" class="headerlink" title="What’s query tuning?"></a>What’s query tuning?</h2><p>A query is a request for information from a database. It can be as simple as “find the email address of the Social Tables user named Inigo Montoya”, or more complex like “find the ASP of all Social Tables opportunities closed on Fridays that followed a Thursday evening Happy Hour.”</p>
<p>Since database structures are complex, in most cases, and especially for not-very-simple queries, the needed data for a query can be collected from a database by accessing it in different ways, through different data-structures, and in different orders. Each different way typically requires different processing time. Processing times of the same query may have large variance, from a fraction of a second to hours, depending on the way selected. The purpose of query tuning, is to find the way to process a given query in minimum time.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-query-tuning-…-in-English-preferably-with-pictures-and-how-can-it-wreck-my-whole-day"><a href="#What’s-query-tuning-…-in-English-preferably-with-pictures-and-how-can-it-wreck-my-whole-day" class="headerlink" title="What’s query tuning … in English (preferably with pictures) and how can it wreck my whole day?"></a>What’s query tuning … in English (preferably with pictures) and how can it wreck my whole day?</h2><p>Query tuning is an effort to minimize the work performed while answering a query. If done poorly, database queries execute slowly and your application responds slowly. When your application responds slowly bad things happen - like Mary posting a screenshot to #devops (aka your whole day is wrecked).</p>
<p>Last week, Michael Dumont spent some time tuning several queries in our platform and his visuals of that effort are worth &gt; 1,000 words:</p>
<p>Orange = a measure of platform activity<br>Blue = a measure of how hard the database is working<br><img src="/images/query-tuning-1.png"></p>
<p>Note: unlike Social Tables’ Engineers, our database refuses to work harder than 100% … so those blue peaks are signs of unhappy Social Tables users.</p>
<p>Here are the same measurements after tuning:<br><img src="/images/query-tuning-2.png"></p>
<p>Happier database === Happier users</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted the following on an internal blog at Social Tables in an attempt to explain a bit about what our Software Engineering group was up to at the time.</p>
<hr>
<p>We’ve got a special subject this issue to take the edge off that geek-withdrawal : “Drawing Text with Signed Distance Fields” or using SDF text rendering for those in the know.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-SDF"><a href="#What’s-SDF" class="headerlink" title="What’s SDF?"></a>What’s SDF?</h2><p>Signed distance field (SDF) is a technique for rendering bitmap fonts without jagged edges even at high magnifications. It was first introduced in 2007 with <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">this bit of light reading by Valve</a> and couples the use of a bitmap and glyphs with a GLSL shader that can sample and sharpen said glyphs.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-SDF-…-in-English-preferably-with-pictures"><a href="#What’s-SDF-…-in-English-preferably-with-pictures" class="headerlink" title="What’s SDF … in English (preferably with pictures)?"></a>What’s SDF … in English (preferably with pictures)?</h2><p>So…you know what sounds easy but is really really hard? Drawing legible letters in Venue Mapper. Wait - what? Why’s that hard you ask?</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of “Social Tables” rendered in 12pt font by Microsoft Word:</p>
<p><img src="/images/sdf-1.png"></p>
<p>Completely legible. But here’s that exact same image after I zoom in a few times:</p>
<p><img src="/images/sdf-2.png"></p>
<p>Not so great. Possibly legible but if we rendered text like this as users zoom in and out in Venue Mapper we’d have to bundle subscriptions with aspirin.</p>
<p>SDF is a technique we’ve just begun using to more efficiently render text in Venue Mapper 3 - it performs better (app is faster) and looks prettier than the techniques we’ve used previously.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/8yt7kSftNU4" target="_blank" rel="external">movie of SDF in action in VM3 courtesy of our own Van Drunen</a>.</p>

      <url>/2015/01/07/2015-01-07-fix-yaml-parsing-errors-in-webgen/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a clean install of Mac OS X Yosemite I’ve had to reinstall much of my development environment. This process was mostly beneficial as I moved to the latest and greatest tooling but several of my static websites leverage the prior major version of <a href="http://webgen.gettalong.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Thomas Leitner’s Webgen</a> and getting version 0.5.x up and running has been a challenge.  </p>
<p>After working through several Ruby &amp; Gem issues I ran into a particularly opaque error when executing webgen on a project that previously generated without issue: “(<unknown>): found character that cannot start any token while scanning for the next token”</unknown></p>
<p>This error is usually a sign that your content contains tab characters but I’d already ensured that wasn’t the case.  Instead of diving deep into the workings of the libraries at play I was able to use <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/webgen-users/wYYWrwljJ1Y/Q8G4SzG_lEcJ" target="_blank" rel="external">this post from Thomas to resolve the issue</a> by reverting to the syck TAML implementation instead of its replacement.  Problem solved!</p>

      <url>/2014/02/01/2014-02-01-resolving-h2-table-lock-during-junitrunner-test/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After adding a new test to a project that uses Play Framework 1.2.X and thus leverages H2 for Junit functional testing, I began encountering a table lock during setup() when the framework was attempting to delete the contents of an entity table.</p>
<p>I initially blamed the lock on bad model design and wasted a significant amount of time tweaking JPA entity relationships and corresponding CRUD operations in an attempt to resolve it. I ultimately resolved the issue after realizing it was in fact caused by a badly designed test.</p>
<p>I was directly modifying entities within the transaction that wrapped my functional test and then emulating API calls that relied upon the state of those same entities. Long story short, my test was attempting something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>class FunctionalTest { //Runs entire test in the same transaction

    setup(){
        //reset H2 datastore in an distinct transaction
    }

    atest(){ 
        User u = User.findById(1);
        u.address = new Address();
        u.save();

        //test continues
    }

    btest(){
        Request req = GET(&quot;/user/1&quot;);

    }
}
</code></pre><p>In my contrived example above, after Junit runs atest() and just before running btest() - it will call setup() and attempt to reset the database in a separate transaction. But, atest() claimed a lock for insert on User and in H2 that locks the entire table by default thus setup() will be unable to reset the User table and will fail with a lock timeout.</p>
<p>To resolve this - you’ll either need to redesign your test to avoid manipulating entities directly in the testcase or run each test in a distinct transaction. </p>

      <url>/2013/10/29/2013-10-29-plesk-11-upgrade-unable-to-run-perl/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
After an upgrade to Plesk 11, my Perl scripts  located under cgi-bin/ for a specific domain were not executing properly.
	Requests generated HTTP response code 500 and my error logs showed the unhelpful message "Premature end of script headers"
	I verified all permissions and even disabled / re-enabled cgi-bin support through Plesk which installs a test script under cgi-bin/test/test.cgi
	Even the test script failed to run. It also generated the message "Premature end of script headers: test.cgi"
	I eventually resolved the issue with two changes:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>The domain's root folder in /var/www/vhosts was not owned by the domain user. So I fixed that with a chown command.</li>
<li>Within the Plesk control panel, I had to disable "Perl" support and enable "CGI" support to get my perl scripts with the ".pl" extension to run under cgi-bin</li>
</ol>

<div class="post">
<p>The default JDBCTemplate based implementation of Spring Security ACLs removes and recreates the entire ACL for each update. That requires both deletes and inserts into the same table within the same JPA transaction and is a recipe for deadlock when using the default MySQL transaction isolation level of REPEATABLE_READ.&nbsp;</p><p>Setting your transaction isolation level to READ_COMMITTED is a viable alternative to MySQL's default but be certain you are not using the default bin-log format of Statement as this is not compatible with READ_COMMITTED isolation.

<p>In my quest for the perfect sync for the relatively small set of sensitive files I want available from all my workstations I've tried several cloud based services: Dropbox, JungleDisk,&nbsp;Wuala, and Egnyte just to name a few.</p><p>Dropbox and JungleDisk both require custom-rolled workarounds (like using a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">TrueCrypt</a> volume) to keep sensitive files secured.

Wuala encrypts your data with a private key before transmitting it, but their client is quite cumbersome.

Two months later I have a micro USB drive and am finally starting the upgrades.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">2. Use App Store to download &amp; install XCode</span></p><p>Annoying. At least they fixed the download process to support resumes. Mine cutoff at 98% of the 4G download but picked back up where it left off on resume.</p><p><span style="font-size:large;">3. Run &nbsp;"/Applications/Install Xcode.app"</span></p><p>So when App Store said it was "Installing Xcode" it meant it was installing the Xcode installer.

Our CI server (we use Jenkins) recently began bombing on several new tests that referenced java.awt packaged classes. The most common error in the stacktrace was "NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.awt.Color" and diving deeper we could see the root cause was  "Can't connect to window server - not enough permissions".<br>The interwebs all claimed setting <code class="java plain">-Djava.awt.headless=true</code> would resolve the issue but it did nothing for us. We set it as a Jenkins system parameter, in the launchctl job, in the bash_profile of the Jenkins user on the machine, and everywhere we could in the Jenkins job itself....to no avail.<br>Just before heading down the path of setting it programatically somewhere in our test stack - I noticed that our&nbsp;maven-surefire-plugin was configured to use a threadCount of 10.

I encountered all types of strange behavior using Firefox 4 after my recent upgrade. The nastiest bug prevented me from accessing any windows other than the primary Firefox window. So all popups, while listed on the Windows menu, were completely inaccessible. I tried all the typical workarounds like disabling Addons and running in Safemode. But nothing permanently fixed the issue.<p>  Finally - I simply created a new Firefox profile and <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Transferring_data_to_a_new_profile_-_Firefox" target="_blank" rel="external">transferred the bookmarks, passwords</a>, etc... that I wanted to carryover. This resolved my issues completely. So before you throw away FF4 in frustration - try creating a clean profile. Probably not a bad idea anyway - I noticed FF3.0 cruft in my profile that I shed as part of this process.</p></div>

It takes about 15 minutes to spin an instance up. <br> </li> </ul> </ul> With either method of obtaining a virtual machine, you'll have to decide how to handle testing for all the permutations you need to support. The "brute force" method is to create a virtual machine for each permutation of OS, Browser, Flash Player, etc...&nbsp; There are some other options though:<br> <ul> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/WEB-Design/Web-Design-related/Expression-Web-SuperPreview.shtml" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview</a> for Windows Internet Explorer&nbsp;</li> <ul> <li>can be used to test basic IE6 support on a machine with a more recent version installed - but not a terribly accurate emulator<br> </li> </ul> <li>Internet Explorer 8 with Developer Tools installed <br> </li> <ul> <li>using "Compatibility" mode to emulate IE7 works well enough to debug javascript</li> </ul> </ul> </ul></div>

<p>After updating a named query using HQL to constrain on a Collection of objects determined at runtime, Hibernate began throwing "org.hibernate.PropertyAccessException: IllegalArgumentException occurred calling getter" while apparently attempting to access the "id" property of an object in my model.</p><p>My named query looked something like this:<br><code>select p from Parent p where p.child in (:children)</code><br>and I was calling it like so:<br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Query query = session.getNamedQuery(queryName);query.setParameter("children", aCollectionOfChildren);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;query.list();</code><br>It took me a bit of trial and error to realize that Hibernate expected the Collection to be passed in using "query.setParameterList" instead of "query.setParameter".

<div class="post">
I was fond of the stack <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank" rel="external">XAMPP</a> offered when I developed on Windows and lazily continued used <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">XAMPP/MAMP</a> once I moved to a Mac OS X based workstation. Unfortunately, the latest releases of MAMP have attempted to restrict the utility of the stack in an effort to raise revenue through a less restricted "Pro" version. Developers on Snow Leopard are much better off moving to standalone installations of everything MAMP offers.There are many ways to install PHP, MySQL, Apache, and phpMyAdmin - all with a list of pros/cons. Without debating the merits, here's what I did to replace MAMP:<h2>1. Dump your MAMP Mysql databases and save them for import into your standalone MySQL install</h2><code>mysqldump --all-databases &gt; ~/old-mysql-data.sql</code><h2>2. Install a more recent copy of MySQL server than the one delivered with Snow Leopard</h2>I already had <a href="http://www.macports.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">macports</a> installed, so the choice here was easy. The following command installs the mysql binaries under /opt/local/bin/<code>port install mysql5 mysql5-server</code><h2>3. Import your data into your new MySQL database</h2>First, be certain to shutdown all the MAMP servers (MySQL, Apache, etc...) - then start your new standalone MySQL<code>sudo /opt/local/bin/mysqld_safe5 &amp;</code>Finally, run the following:<code>mysql <h2>4. Install phpMyAdmin on the SL delivered Apache installation</h2>Install it fresh, or just copy your MAMP installation to ~/Sites where it will be available under http://localhost/~your-username/<h2>5. Enable PHP5 on the SL delivered Apache installation</h2>Open /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and enable the line: "#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so" by removing the pound. Then in the Mac System Pref -&gt; Sharing, turn on (or if it was already on, turn off/on) Web Sharing. If you need to move any vhost or SSL config directives from MAMP to the SL Apache install, you'll make those changes to files in /etc/apache2/extra/<h2>6. Optional - Configure PHP by creating a php.ini under /etc</h2>I'm content to use the PHP installation already delivered by SL, but there is no default php.ini - simply create one under /etc and it'll be read automatically.You can now remove the MAMP training wheels and proceed developing with full standalone versions of your stack - happy trails.</code></div>

I'm using the 2TB GoFlex as my Time Machine drive and needed to resolve this annoyance as well. I've opened a ticket with Seagate Support directly, but so far they've been unable to completely resolve the issue.The only thing that seems to help is to go into System Prefs -&gt; Energy Saver and turn off the feature that puts Hard Drives to sleep. With that power saving feature disabled the Seagate only complains when my Mac actually wakes from sleep - that's an improvement but still no love.</div>

<p>SVN 1.4 added a feature to support easy rollback of a SVN commit. It's documented in SVN help, but unfortunately SVN help only makes sense if you already understand what it's trying to explain. Here's the easy commit revert command to run against your working copy:</p><p>svn merge -c -[REV] [REPO]</p><p>Replace the brackets with the offending revision number and your SVN repository respectively. For example, to undo the changes made by revision 42:</p><p>svn merge -c -42 <a href="http://example.com/svn/trunk" target="_blank" rel="external">http://example.com/svn/trunk</a> .</p></div>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<div class="post">
<a href="http://www.gnucash.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">GnuCash</a> served me well while I was running Ubuntu as my primary desktop but since moving to a Mac Pro I've been disappointed in the performance and non-native nature of the GnuCash Mac port. I decided to migrate to <a href="http://moneydance.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">MoneyDance</a> and was quickly dismayed to discover GnuCash's poor support for standards based exporting.This GnuCash wiki-entry <a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_export_data.3F" target="_blank" rel="external">describes a few convoluted approaches to data export</a> but the items it references are hopelessly outdated and generally do not function for the latest stable release - reason enough to ditch GnuCash.MoneyDance hadn't solved the problem on their end either but their wiki does <a href="http://moneydance.com/trac/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#CanIimportmyGnuCashdata" target="_blank" rel="external">reference a Perl script that converts the deprecated GnuCash Postgre storage format into a MoneyDance XML file</a>. Since I knew that the development release of GnuCash supports a SQLite storage format I decided to see if I could update Sid Reed's aforementioned script for this new SQLite container.I'm no Perl Monger, but <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/" target="_blank" rel="external">I do know regular expressions</a>. My updated script worked well for me and seamlessly converted several years of GnuCash data.  Please read the pre-requisites section in the header of this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ericsimmerman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GnuCash-MoneyDance-Importer.zip" target="_blank" rel="external">GnuCash to MoneyDance Migration Script</a> before attempting to run it. In addition to the linked zip archive, <a href="http://github.com/ets/MoneyDance-GnuCash-Importer" target="_blank" rel="external">this script is also available on github</a>. Enjoy!</div>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<div class="post">
I've been evaluating the opensource <a href="http://www.cerberusweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cerberus Helpdesk</a> as an alternative to the closed source Kayako esupport. I like how Cerberus separates the creation of multiple knowledgebases that can then be published across multiple community portals. Instead of one comprehensive knowledgebase presented to all customers, I can use Cerberus to present product specific knowledgebases. It's a nice concept that should make it much easier for a customer to locate support information and thereby reduce the number of support tickets generated.Customizing the public facing portals for my Cerberus installation was straightforward.  The admin console provided a good degree of flexibility, but I wanted a bit more so I manually modified usermeet.core/templates/portal/sc/module/index.tpl in order to insert analytics scripts and some more detailed customization. That was easy, but my next mod proved more difficult. By default, Cerberus displays 10 articles on each page of search results and I wanted to increase that count to 20. Cerberus' architecture actually makes it a bit tricky to determine the control flow used by the community portals but I eventually traced the article retrieval flow to the DAO_KbArticle class in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/App.php and changed the default limit on the search method from 10 to 20. The limit is set as a hardcoded constant in the method signature....yuck. After the change, 20 articles were pulled from the database on each request, but there were still only 10 displayed in the portal.It took a lot of searching to find the missing piece and it was yet another hardcoded value in plugins/cerberusweb.kb/api/sc/kb.php where $view-&gt;renderLimit was set to 10. Changing this gave me the desired row count on the portal.The Cerberus team has put together a nice product but given that one of its core competitive features is its opensource nature, I'd like to see the codebase refactored to better facilitate this type of customization. Values like these limits could easily be defined in framework.config.php instead of scattering hardcoded settings across multiple files. That said, at least I had to option to manipulate the software - something I can't do with Kayako's offering.</div>

I hopefully added "-clean" as the first parameter of my eclipse.ini file and restarted but the situation remained unchanged. Undeterred, I launched eclipse from the command line with a -clean startup parameter and this did the trick:/Applications/&lt;your install dir/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse -clean</div>

I recently encountered an issue where I was unable to add a JVM to my Eclipse install on Snow Leopard. There was no MacOS X VM option under Installed JREs -&gt; Add and attempting to use the Standard VM resulted in an error. After digging around in Eclipse bug reports, I discovered this is a known issue with the Cocoa build of Galileo with PDT pre-installed.&nbsp; The easy fix is to install Eclipse without PDT (just install the Eclipse IDE for Java - Cocoa 64 bit) and add PDT plugin later. When you take this route, the MacOS X VM will be configured automagically.</div>

After a recent Apple update, copy and paste quit functioning on my Snow Leopard install. After a number of red herrings, I eventually traced the issue to <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Synergy</a> and noticed that synergyc constantly emptied my clipboard immediately after any copy operation. I was running synergy 1.3.1 at the time which was released back in 2006 - I was hopeful that the latest release of the Synergy fork <a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/" target="_blank" rel="external">Synergy Plus</a> might provide a quick solution.An install of synergy-plus 1.3.4 Darwin binary did not resolve the issue and a build of the latest from subversion (r252) would not run for me (separate issue - synergyc unable to resolve server address).I happened upon <a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/detail?id=67#c85" target="_blank" rel="external">this thread</a> in my search for an answer and based on comments there decided to build revision 242 for my Mac client and run 252 on my Ubuntu server. Happy to report it resolved my issues.One note - I was thrown for a bit when my first Xcode build resulted in 14 compile time errors. Turns out it was necessary for me to build for i386 as the 64-bit build would not compile for me.UPDATE: After a couple weeks use, I found the synergy-plus binary to be rather buggy and went in search of a solution. MacPorts supports a patched build of synergy 1.3.1 for Snow Leopard and so far it is working beautifully. Assuming you have ports installed, the following will install the tried and true synergy.<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">port clean synergy ; port install synergy +universal</blockquote></div>

Here are some notes from the field on setting up all these development services to play nice on Mac OS X Server 10.6:<ul><li>Use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/server/subversionwithxcode3.html" target="_blank" rel="external">this excellent writeup from Apple</a> to get Subversion setup as a webservice. Note the comment about how the DAV setting can revert to DAV no and need correction. I've found that it sometimes reverts to "DAV On" and this will break your subversion service...it must always be set to DAV svn</li><li>Configure Jira using Server Admin's "Sites" panel for configuring the Web service. Under Sites-&gt;Proxy configure an ajp worker to talk to your Jira instance. I installed jira on its own context /jira as opposed to root and therefore set the worker URL path as well as the Proxy Path to /jira</li><li>For running under the same hostname/virtual host any additional balancer groups will need to be configured manually. I was able to configure an ajp balancer for sonar but had to use a http balancer for hudson. Avoid using 8443 for your ports for any customer services as Apple's iCal is configured for this one by default.</li></ul></div>

After upgrading to Snow Leopard and all its 64-bit goodness, I discovered that the upgrade to python 2.6.1 64-bit understandably broke my python-mysql connector which was previously compiled against my 32-bit installation of XAMPP with MySQL.

After installing a new GoDaddy SSL certificate in Tomcat 5.5.x my web browsers were able to properly negotiate SSL connections, but when back-end code  attempted (specifically when CAS attempted to validate a ticket through Cas20ServiceTicketValidator) to connect using SSL the "CA key usage check failed: keyCertSign bit is not set" error was being thrown. <p>My tomcat server is fronted by Apache2 and Apache handles SSL negotiation. I discovered that I had improperly installed the intermediate certificate for GoDaddy and while modern browsers just ignored the resulting misconfiguration, Java was complaining.</p><p>I had set the SSLCertificateChainFile directive to point to the "cert-chain.crt" file. The mistake is understandable given the near identical naming of the directive and the file...but alas that intuitive connection is erroneous.

After installing the latest Mac OSX upgrade Skype began giving me trouble. I found <a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=409531" target="_blank" rel="external">this thread</a> in Skype's forums which attests to the issue. Downgrading to 2.7.0 is suggested as a solution there, but it did not work for me. The downgraded version still locked-up and refused to quit without a force. However, I kept 2.7.0.330 installed and convinced OS X to install <a href="http://www.apple.com/rosetta/" target="_blank" rel="external">Rosetta</a> (it prompted me for the install automatically when I attempted to launch Photoshop). After the Rosetta install and reboot, Skype 2.7.0.330 functioned properly for a few sessions and then fell down taking the whole kernel with it via the black screen of death. I've since upgraded to 2.8.0.659 which doesn't seem to crash but just stops working occasionally. The symptom exhibited is that messages stay in the "pending..." state and are simply never delivered.<p>UPDATE: I've resolved my issues by explicitly opening the Skype inbound port (the default is 65269 and it's configurable under Preferences -&gt; Advanced) in my firewall. This was not needed until I upgraded to Snow Leopard but apparently is now required to keep Skype functioning properly. I maintain a custom firewall configuration using /sbin/ipfw and I added the following line to /etc/rc.firewall to open the Skype inbound port.<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>add 3020 allow log tcp from any to any 65269 in</pre></div></div><br>After saving that and restarting ipfw Skype is functioning as expected.</p></div>

      <url>/2009/08/13/2009-08-13-spring-security-acl-intercept-methods/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<div class="post">
I recently used Spring to configure a manager to use Spring Security ACL method-level authorization. Here's a snip of my initial manager bean config:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;bean id=&quot;clientManager&quot; class=&quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&quot;&gt;    &lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&quot;accessDecisionManager&quot;&gt;        &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;get&quot; access=&quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&quot;/&gt;        &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;save&quot; access=&quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&quot;/&gt;    &lt;/sec:intercept-methods&gt;    &lt;constructor-arg ref=&quot;clientDao&quot;/&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;mutableAclService&quot; ref=&quot;aclService&quot;/&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;</pre></div></div>With this configuration, my unit tests verified that the method-level authorization was working as expected. Next, I applied some declarative transaction management to the same manager:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;aop:config&gt;    &lt;aop:advisor id=&quot;managerTx&quot; advice-ref=&quot;txAdvice&quot; pointcut=&quot;execution(* *..service.*Manager.*(..))&quot; order=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/aop:config&gt;&lt;tx:advice id=&quot;txAdvice&quot;&gt;    &lt;tx:attributes&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;get*&quot; read-only=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;save*&quot; rollback-for=&quot;DuplicateNameException,UserExistsException&quot; /&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;    &lt;/tx:attributes&gt;&lt;/tx:advice&gt;</pre></div></div>After adding this transaction advice, my unit tests failed method-level authorization checks. I never traced the issue to its absolute root cause, but based upon some open tickets against Spring I believe the error was due to a "double-proxy" type issue. The short story is that proxies are final, and Spring can't proxy a proxy...<p>Regardless of the root cause, I found a reasonable workaround was to revert to one of the "old" (more verbose) methods of transaction demarcation. Here's what my final working configuration looks like:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;bean id=&quot;baseTransactionProxy&quot; abstract=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean&quot;&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;transactionManager&quot; ref=&quot;transactionManager&quot;/&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;transactionAttributes&quot;&gt;        &lt;props&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;get*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly&lt;/prop&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;save*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,-DuplicateNameException,-UserExistsException&lt;/prop&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&lt;/prop&gt;        &lt;/props&gt;    &lt;/property&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;&lt;bean id=&quot;clientManager&quot; parent=&quot;baseTransactionProxy&quot;&gt;  &lt;property name=&quot;target&quot;&gt;    &lt;bean class=&quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&quot;&gt;        &lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&quot;accessDecisionManager&quot;&gt;          &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;get&quot; access=&quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&quot;/&gt;          &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;save&quot; access=&quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&quot;/&gt;        &lt;/sec:intercept-methods&gt;        &lt;constructor-arg ref=&quot;clientDao&quot;/&gt;        &lt;property name=&quot;mutableAclService&quot; ref=&quot;aclService&quot;/&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;  &lt;/property&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;</pre></div></div>By leveraging the TransactionProxyFactoryBean directly instead of relying upon the tx:advice and aop:config tags, I was able to wrap my Spring ACL secured methods with declarative transactions. Nice.</p></div>

<p>Setting up my new QA server should have been simple, but a cryptic issue with Resin cost me five hours. Here's the rundown so you can learn from my pain.</p><p>I copied my production copy of Resin over to a new QA server which is more or less identical - both run RHEL5 with the same version of openssl and same Java runtime. It fired up an ran perfectly...there were only two things I wanted to change. I wanted to:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to the latest version of Resin - from 3.1.7 to 3.1.9</li><li>Install a new SSL certificate to match the QA server's hostname</li></ul>The task at hand looked so simple I decided to make both changes at once without testing in between....big mistake. I flew through the upgrade process and grabbed a new certificate from GoDaddy (the same CA used for the existing certificate). When I fired up the new Resin it started with no errors but when I attempted to pull a page over SSL my browser returned a "no common encryption algorithms" error.<p>I thought support for certain algorithms must have changed in the latest release and thus spent an inordinate amount of time chasing my tail in the belief that the issue was related to the Resin minor version upgrade. After recognizing that dead-end, I ran through every openssl test I knew and learned a few more along the way. After much trial and error I finally noticed my mistake. I was still using the certificate-chain-file associated with the production certificate.</p><p>The first certificate in a certificate chain file is <b>your</b> server/domain certificate. Thus, I needed to replace the first certificate in the chain in order to use it with my QA server. That took two minutes...then all was well with SSL support in my new QA server.</p></div>

Dear US Consumer Product Safety Commission<br>CC: everyone<br><p>    On the morning of June 27th 2009, electrical power to my household was briefly disrupted around 3:30am by several breaks in service over a period of about 20 seconds. Approximately 5 minutes after the disruption, I noticed thick black smoke billowing from a room housing several electronic devices. I was able to enter the room and identify the source of the smoke as the burning plastic of my Belkin "Conceal" Surge Protector. I was thankfully able to quickly terminate power to the device and remove the smoldering plastic from my home.</p><p>As the attached photos demonstrate, the heat from the Belkin burned several holes into the baseboard of the wall behind it and charred the surrounding floor and wall. At the time of the incident, there were only three devices plugged into the Belkin: a speaker, halogen lamp, and laptop computer. Both the speaker and lamp were powered off and the laptop was only drawing power as needed to replenish its battery. Aside from damage to their power cords all three devices were unharmed. I purchased this Belkin Surge Protector from Staples on July 25th 2007 (I have the original receipt) and it was never damaged, repaired, or modified in any way prior to this incident.</p><p>My wife &amp; eight-week old daughter were present in our home with me at the time of this incident. In addition to the obvious structural damage pictured, the room suffered significant smoke damage &amp; lingering odors from the toxic fumes. Clearly my family and I are lucky to have only experienced this relatively minor loss from such a potentially harmful incident. I am writing you today in the hope that this information may prevent other consumers from exposure to this potentially lethal &amp; hazardous product.</p><p>I have kept the product and would be happy to submit it for your inspection. The particulars of my Belkin are:<br>Model: BZ 111234-10<br>File No: E89769<br>Serial: 061016716-18079<br>Manufactured: Sept 02, 2006<br>Made in China<br></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz" height="640" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz-scaled500.jpg?w=225" width="480"></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div></div>

<div class="post">
<p>If DBUnit starts throwing MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException while performing a CLEAN_INSERT you can lose quite a bit of sleep attempting to resolve it or you can cheat and get back to work. The shortcut is to simply disable constraints for the INSERT operation by disabling constraints for DBUnit altogether. You can do that by adding sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 to your JDBC connection string to MySQL. I use maven and in pom.xml my configuration for the dbunit plugin looks like this</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;&lt;artifactId&gt;dbunit-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;&lt;version&gt;1.0-beta-1&lt;/version&gt;&lt;configuration&gt;    &lt;dataTypeFactoryName&gt;${dbunit.dataTypeFactoryName}&lt;/dataTypeFactoryName&gt;    &lt;driver&gt;${jdbc.driverClassName}&lt;/driver&gt;    &lt;username&gt;${jdbc.username}&lt;/username&gt;    &lt;password&gt;${jdbc.password}&lt;/password&gt;    &lt;url&gt;${jdbc.url}&amp;amp;sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0&lt;/url&gt;    &lt;src&gt;src/test/resources/sample-data.xml&lt;/src&gt;    &lt;type&gt;${dbunit.operation.type}&lt;/type&gt;    &lt;schema&gt;${dbunit.schema}&lt;/schema&gt;    &lt;skip&gt;${maven.test.skip}&lt;/skip&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div></div><p>Keep in mind that if you choose to do this your dbunit tests will run with constraints disabled....generally not a recommended approach. Caveat Emptor.</p></div>

<p>I've had automatic updates enabled on my Ganymede install of Eclipse. Huge mistake. Today a Subversive upgrade moved me into an unworkable state and I lost some development time recovering.

Even a fresh install of Eclipse failed to correct the situation.

PHP and Ruby syntax are far enough apart that I was loathe to attempt a port of some working PHP scripts in my arsenal, but I needed to call said scripts from a relatively complex Ruby program.

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<div class="post">
Using Spring MVC's checkboxes (or radiobuttons) tag to render form inputs for an enum property is easy and clean...once you know how. After a little gnashing of teeth, due to the fact that I needed a specific display order for all options, I found the following solution:<p>Here's the tag in my jsp<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;form:checkboxes itemValue=&quot;value&quot; itemLabel=&quot;label&quot;  path=&quot;user.degrees&quot; items=&quot;${degreeLabels }&quot; /&gt;</pre></div></div><br>Here's the way I populated my model map to retain ordering. (I placed this code in my FormController's referenceData method)<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>List labelValues = new ArrayList&lt;LabelValue&gt;();        for (Degree d : Degree.values()) {            labelValues.add(new LabelValue(d.name(), d.name()));        }        Map model = new HashMap();        model.put(&quot;degreeLabels&quot;, labelValues);</pre></div></div>FYI, I ripped the LabelValue class used above from Matt Riable's excellent Appfuse project. The constructor takes two arguments which are mapped to the properties "value" and "label" and these properties have the typical pojo getters and setters.<br>You can see from the path on my tag that degrees is a property on my User object...which is the target of my form. Here's what that looks like...I threw in my Hibernate annotations for the curious:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>private Set&lt;Degree&gt; degrees = new HashSet&lt;Degree&gt;();    @CollectionOfElements    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)    public Set&lt;Degree&gt; getDegrees() {        return degrees;    }    public void setDegrees(Set&lt;Degree&gt; degrees) {        this.degrees = degrees;    }</pre></div></div>It's probably obvious, but here's what the Degree enum looks like:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>public enum Degree {    BA,BS,BN,BSW,MA,MS,MBA,MSN,MSW,MD,JD,PhD,PharmD,PsyD,Other;}</pre></div></div></p></div>

<a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/" target="_blank" rel="external">TurboTax Online</a>'s investment sale (stock, mutual fund, etc sales for capital gains) entry screen is a nice example of braindead design. Although the application provides a "bulk-entry spreadsheet-like interface", there's no import function available. So despite having all of my data in a nice spreadsheet (exported from the MS Money capital gains report) I was still faced with the prospect of manually entering each field from dozens of transactions. Worse still, the interface limits your access to seven rows/transactions per page.<p>Applescript to the rescue! It's an ugly solution, but it saved me a ton of time and helped avoid any manual entry typos:<ol><li>Use your spreadsheet program to arrange your transaction data into columns matching those in TurboTax's interface. You should have five columns. Insure that the dates are formatted as mm/dd/yy</li><li>Copy and paste the data into your favorite text editor as tab-delimited text (I used the excellent TextMate)</li><li>Use search and replace to convert all the tabs into <div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&quot; &amp; tab &amp; &quot;</pre></div></div></li><li>Use search and replace to insert the following at the beginning of every line <div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>keystroke &quot;</pre></div></div></li><li>Use search and replace to insert the following at the end of every line <div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&quot; &amp; tab</pre></div></div></li><li>Now each line should look something like this<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>keystroke &quot;ACME Stock&quot; &amp; tab &amp; &quot;11/10/08&quot; &amp; tab &amp; &quot;100.12&quot; &amp; tab &amp; &quot;1/12/05&quot; &amp; tab &amp; &quot;584.12&quot; &amp; tab</pre></div></div></li><li>Paste the following script into the Script Editor application on your Mac<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>tell application &quot;System Events&quot;        tell process &quot;Firefox&quot;--Clearly replace Firefox above if you are using a different browser                set frontmost to true--Transactions go here        end tellend tell</pre></div></div></li><li>Cut 7 lines at a time from your text editor, paste them into the Script Editor and click "Run"</li><li>The script will populate the TurboTax screen with your data.

So my upgrade to Verizon FiOS included swapping my Linksys WRT54G access point for the Verizon branded ActionTec device that came with the FiOS install. This swap wasn't strictly necessary, but the ActionTec doubles as both the router and access point so I decided I might as well make use of the wireless capabilities since I have to keep it plugged in either way.The only problem I encountered was that my Linksys WRT54G bridge couldn't play nice with the ActionTec. Through trial and error I found that setting both devices to encrypt using WPA2-PSK using AES only (not the default TKIP+AES) resolved my issues.</div>

During a recent Mac migration, I hosed my iTunes library and unintentionally generated hundreds of duplicate songs (the actual media files). The problem was exacerbated by the fact that a numeric was generally appended to the duplicate filenames so that I had directories full of files like the following:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>/artist/album/song.mp3/artist/album/song 1.mp3/artist/album/song 2.mp3</pre></div></div>Apple wasn't doing me any favors by injecting a space in the new names either....what a mess!<p>I stole a few ideas from <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-97701.html" target="_blank" rel="external">this excellent forum thread</a> and cobbled together a script to remove files based on exact byte counts and md5sum signatures. Here's the good stuff:</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/bashfind . ! -empty -type f -printf &quot;%s &quot; -exec ls -dQ {} ; | sort -n | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2- | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 -d | cut -c35- | while read filenamedo echo &quot;Removing $filenamen&quot; rm &quot;$filename&quot;done</pre></div></div>Now here's the play-by-play:<ol><li>Prints out the size and filename of each file found on the path and sorts using the filesize as the key</li><li>Trims off the file size in preparation for next stage</li><li>Creates the checksum for the files of the same size and then sorts by result</li><li>Strip out any checksums that are unique, leaving only the duplicates</li><li>Strips out the checksum part, just leaving the duplicate filenames</li><li>Loops through the results removing the first duplicate file of each set.</li></ol>You'll need to run the script multiple times if you've managed to generate more than one copy of any given file. Good luck!</div>

My daemon log was showing this:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>nfssvc: writing fds to kernel failed: errno 98 (Address already in use)</pre></div></div><br>After much angst, I finally stumbled upon <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2007/01/msg00343.html" target="_blank" rel="external">this posting</a> that mentioned a conflict between avahi-daemon and NFSd.

<p>I'm happy to announce that my company (<a href="http://www.tempeststrings.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Tempest Strings Enterprises</a>) has sponsored my development and release of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/" target="_blank" rel="external">MathML</a> library for <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenLaszlo</a>. I'll be working through the OpenLaszlo contributor process, but imagine that it could take a considerable amount of time before you see this work in their repository since I've not yet made any effort to adhere to any coding guidelines. There is very little documentation in the source, no consistent style, and no support for any runtime except SWF. Nevertheless, I've already successfully integrated the library with a larger application and it is functioning well in our beta release.</p><br><p>This library is based upon the <a href="http://www.learn-math.info/mathml.htm?action=formula" target="_blank" rel="external">Flash Actionscript library</a> that ionel-alexandru (Sourceforge username) of learn-math.info donated to the public domain. I make heavy use of Alex's object tree and MathML rendering logic (thanks Alex!). I've built upon OpenLaszlo's Drawview class from their SVN trunk and added support for rendering stand-alone MathML from a datasource as well as formulas placed inline with other text.</p><p><br></p><p>Note that the full set of MathML has not yet been implemented (ex: no support for &lt;mtable&gt;) but here are some examples of supported formulas:</p><p></p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;dataset name=&quot;example1&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msqrt&gt;

<div class="post">
In the 1.0.4 release, there is no indicator of which post you are currently viewing within a threaded tree of posts. Here's my hack to implement such an indicator.<p>Under your chosen template directory (ex: components/com_fireboard/templates/default), edit the thread.php file. Look for the TR with class="fb_threadview_row" and modify it like so:<br><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;tr class=&quot;fb_threadview_row&quot; &lt;? if($leaf-&gt;id == (int)$id){ echo &quot;style='background-color:yellow'&quot;; } ?&gt; &gt;</pre></div></div>You can use any background-color value you desire. I used "yellow" in the above example.</p></div>

It can be tough making NFS play nice amongst different distros and firewalls. I'm sharing my Eclipse workspace on my Ubuntu (Debian) desktop with my CentOS (Redhat Enterprise) server. (That's not a mistake, my server is actually my NFS client in this scenario. You could easily swap these roles if you wish)<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>DEBIAN:I used port numbers and config instructions at http://wiki.debian.org/?SecuringNFSFollow those instructions exactly and you'll have a NFS server configuration that uses static ports (instead of random assignements)REDHAT:1. Create the file &quot;/etc/sysconfig/nfs&quot; and add the following contents:STATD_PORT=32765STATD_OUTGOING_PORT=32766LOCKD_TCPPORT=32768LOCKD_UDPPORT=32768MOUNTD_PORT=327672. (Probably not necessary for most, but here for completeness) Append the following to the file &quot;/etc/services&quot;:rquotad 32769/tcp # rpc.rquotad tcp portrquotad 32769/udp # rpc.rquotad udp port3. Restart the nfslock service:/etc/init.d/nfslock restart4. Run /usr/sbin/rpcinfo -p and make sure all the ports above have changed and match their ubuntu numbers. (/usr/bin/rpcinfo on ubuntu)5. I run firestarter on Ubuntu which is exporting my NFS share. I added the following policy rules for inbound traffic:Allow 32767 (from my client machine's IP)Allow 2049 (from my client machine's IP)Allow 111 (from my client machine's IP)</pre></div></div>Assuming you allow all outbound traffic on your client (I recommend this excellent iptables config file <a href="http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/scripts/rc.firewall_023.txt" target="_blank" rel="external">rc.firewall_023.txt</a>), you should now be able to mount the NFS share on the Redhat box.</div>
