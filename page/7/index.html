After installing a new GoDaddy SSL certificate in Tomcat 5.5.x my web browsers were able to properly negotiate SSL connections, but when back-end code  attempted (specifically when CAS attempted to validate a ticket through Cas20ServiceTicketValidator) to connect using SSL the "CA key usage check failed: keyCertSign bit is not set" error was being thrown. <p>My tomcat server is fronted by Apache2 and Apache handles SSL negotiation. I discovered that I had improperly installed the intermediate certificate for GoDaddy and while modern browsers just ignored the resulting misconfiguration, Java was complaining.</p><p>I had set the SSLCertificateChainFile directive to point to the "cert-chain.crt" file. The mistake is understandable given the near identical naming of the directive and the file...but alas that intuitive connection is erroneous.

After installing the latest Mac OSX upgrade Skype began giving me trouble. I found <a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=409531" target="_blank" rel="external">this thread</a> in Skype's forums which attests to the issue. Downgrading to 2.7.0 is suggested as a solution there, but it did not work for me. The downgraded version still locked-up and refused to quit without a force. However, I kept 2.7.0.330 installed and convinced OS X to install <a href="http://www.apple.com/rosetta/" target="_blank" rel="external">Rosetta</a> (it prompted me for the install automatically when I attempted to launch Photoshop). After the Rosetta install and reboot, Skype 2.7.0.330 functioned properly for a few sessions and then fell down taking the whole kernel with it via the black screen of death. I've since upgraded to 2.8.0.659 which doesn't seem to crash but just stops working occasionally. The symptom exhibited is that messages stay in the "pending..." state and are simply never delivered.<p>UPDATE: I've resolved my issues by explicitly opening the Skype inbound port (the default is 65269 and it's configurable under Preferences -&gt; Advanced) in my firewall. This was not needed until I upgraded to Snow Leopard but apparently is now required to keep Skype functioning properly. I maintain a custom firewall configuration using /sbin/ipfw and I added the following line to /etc/rc.firewall to open the Skype inbound port.<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>add 3020 allow log tcp from any to any 65269 in</pre></div></div><br>After saving that and restarting ipfw Skype is functioning as expected.</p></div>

I run VirtualBox on an Ubuntu 64-bit Host with a 32-bit Windows XP guest. I was searching for a way to boost performance and came across <a href="http://matt.bottrell.com.au/archives/265-Improving-VirtualBox-performance.html" target="_blank" rel="external">this post related to configuring a SATA controller</a> for drive access. Matt includes some great info there, but the step-by-step left something to be desired IMHO. Here are my revised instructions for configuring SATA support on your Win XP guest:<ol><li>Start VirtualBox, but do not boot your guest.</li><li>Open Settings for your Win XP guest and select "Hard Disks"</li><li>Check "Enable Additional Controller" and choose "SATA (AHCI)"</li><li>Save your Settings changes and boot your guest</li><li>Inside your guest, download the <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=2101" target="_blank" rel="external">appropriate SATA controller software from Intel</a></li><li>Install the Intel software</li><li>Shutdown your guest</li><li>Go back into VirtualBox Settings for your guest. Select Harddrives again.</li><li>Now change the slot associated with your Windows XP attachments/harddisk(s) from IDE to "SATA Port 0"</li><li>Save your settings</li><li>Start your guest and enjoy the performance boost!<br></li></ol></div>

    <div class="entry">
      
        
<div class="post">
I recently used Spring to configure a manager to use Spring Security ACL method-level authorization. Here's a snip of my initial manager bean config:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;bean id=&quot;clientManager&quot; class=&quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&quot;&gt;    &lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&quot;accessDecisionManager&quot;&gt;        &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;get&quot; access=&quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&quot;/&gt;        &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;save&quot; access=&quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&quot;/&gt;    &lt;/sec:intercept-methods&gt;    &lt;constructor-arg ref=&quot;clientDao&quot;/&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;mutableAclService&quot; ref=&quot;aclService&quot;/&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;</pre></div></div>With this configuration, my unit tests verified that the method-level authorization was working as expected. Next, I applied some declarative transaction management to the same manager:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;aop:config&gt;    &lt;aop:advisor id=&quot;managerTx&quot; advice-ref=&quot;txAdvice&quot; pointcut=&quot;execution(* *..service.*Manager.*(..))&quot; order=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/aop:config&gt;&lt;tx:advice id=&quot;txAdvice&quot;&gt;    &lt;tx:attributes&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;get*&quot; read-only=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;save*&quot; rollback-for=&quot;DuplicateNameException,UserExistsException&quot; /&gt;        &lt;tx:method name=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;    &lt;/tx:attributes&gt;&lt;/tx:advice&gt;</pre></div></div>After adding this transaction advice, my unit tests failed method-level authorization checks. I never traced the issue to its absolute root cause, but based upon some open tickets against Spring I believe the error was due to a "double-proxy" type issue. The short story is that proxies are final, and Spring can't proxy a proxy...<p>Regardless of the root cause, I found a reasonable workaround was to revert to one of the "old" (more verbose) methods of transaction demarcation. Here's what my final working configuration looks like:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;bean id=&quot;baseTransactionProxy&quot; abstract=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean&quot;&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;transactionManager&quot; ref=&quot;transactionManager&quot;/&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;transactionAttributes&quot;&gt;        &lt;props&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;get*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly&lt;/prop&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;save*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,-DuplicateNameException,-UserExistsException&lt;/prop&gt;            &lt;prop key=&quot;*&quot;&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&lt;/prop&gt;        &lt;/props&gt;    &lt;/property&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;&lt;bean id=&quot;clientManager&quot; parent=&quot;baseTransactionProxy&quot;&gt;  &lt;property name=&quot;target&quot;&gt;    &lt;bean class=&quot;com.acme.service.impl.ClientManagerImpl&quot;&gt;        &lt;sec:intercept-methods access-decision-manager-ref=&quot;accessDecisionManager&quot;&gt;          &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;get&quot; access=&quot;AFTER_ACL_READ&quot;/&gt;          &lt;sec:protect method=&quot;save&quot; access=&quot;ROLE_ADMIN,ACL_WRITE&quot;/&gt;        &lt;/sec:intercept-methods&gt;        &lt;constructor-arg ref=&quot;clientDao&quot;/&gt;        &lt;property name=&quot;mutableAclService&quot; ref=&quot;aclService&quot;/&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;  &lt;/property&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;</pre></div></div>By leveraging the TransactionProxyFactoryBean directly instead of relying upon the tx:advice and aop:config tags, I was able to wrap my Spring ACL secured methods with declarative transactions. Nice.</p></div>

<p>Setting up my new QA server should have been simple, but a cryptic issue with Resin cost me five hours. Here's the rundown so you can learn from my pain.</p><p>I copied my production copy of Resin over to a new QA server which is more or less identical - both run RHEL5 with the same version of openssl and same Java runtime. It fired up an ran perfectly...there were only two things I wanted to change. I wanted to:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to the latest version of Resin - from 3.1.7 to 3.1.9</li><li>Install a new SSL certificate to match the QA server's hostname</li></ul>The task at hand looked so simple I decided to make both changes at once without testing in between....big mistake. I flew through the upgrade process and grabbed a new certificate from GoDaddy (the same CA used for the existing certificate). When I fired up the new Resin it started with no errors but when I attempted to pull a page over SSL my browser returned a "no common encryption algorithms" error.<p>I thought support for certain algorithms must have changed in the latest release and thus spent an inordinate amount of time chasing my tail in the belief that the issue was related to the Resin minor version upgrade. After recognizing that dead-end, I ran through every openssl test I knew and learned a few more along the way. After much trial and error I finally noticed my mistake. I was still using the certificate-chain-file associated with the production certificate.</p><p>The first certificate in a certificate chain file is <b>your</b> server/domain certificate. Thus, I needed to replace the first certificate in the chain in order to use it with my QA server. That took two minutes...then all was well with SSL support in my new QA server.</p></div>

Dear US Consumer Product Safety Commission<br>CC: everyone<br><p>    On the morning of June 27th 2009, electrical power to my household was briefly disrupted around 3:30am by several breaks in service over a period of about 20 seconds. Approximately 5 minutes after the disruption, I noticed thick black smoke billowing from a room housing several electronic devices. I was able to enter the room and identify the source of the smoke as the burning plastic of my Belkin "Conceal" Surge Protector. I was thankfully able to quickly terminate power to the device and remove the smoldering plastic from my home.</p><p>As the attached photos demonstrate, the heat from the Belkin burned several holes into the baseboard of the wall behind it and charred the surrounding floor and wall. At the time of the incident, there were only three devices plugged into the Belkin: a speaker, halogen lamp, and laptop computer. Both the speaker and lamp were powered off and the laptop was only drawing power as needed to replenish its battery. Aside from damage to their power cords all three devices were unharmed. I purchased this Belkin Surge Protector from Staples on July 25th 2007 (I have the original receipt) and it was never damaged, repaired, or modified in any way prior to this incident.</p><p>My wife &amp; eight-week old daughter were present in our home with me at the time of this incident. In addition to the obvious structural damage pictured, the room suffered significant smoke damage &amp; lingering odors from the toxic fumes. Clearly my family and I are lucky to have only experienced this relatively minor loss from such a potentially harmful incident. I am writing you today in the hope that this information may prevent other consumers from exposure to this potentially lethal &amp; hazardous product.</p><p>I have kept the product and would be happy to submit it for your inspection. The particulars of my Belkin are:<br>Model: BZ 111234-10<br>File No: E89769<br>Serial: 061016716-18079<br>Manufactured: Sept 02, 2006<br>Made in China<br></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz" height="640" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz-scaled500.jpg?w=225" width="480"></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div></div>

<div class="post">
<p>If DBUnit starts throwing MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException while performing a CLEAN_INSERT you can lose quite a bit of sleep attempting to resolve it or you can cheat and get back to work. The shortcut is to simply disable constraints for the INSERT operation by disabling constraints for DBUnit altogether. You can do that by adding sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 to your JDBC connection string to MySQL. I use maven and in pom.xml my configuration for the dbunit plugin looks like this</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;&lt;artifactId&gt;dbunit-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;&lt;version&gt;1.0-beta-1&lt;/version&gt;&lt;configuration&gt;    &lt;dataTypeFactoryName&gt;${dbunit.dataTypeFactoryName}&lt;/dataTypeFactoryName&gt;    &lt;driver&gt;${jdbc.driverClassName}&lt;/driver&gt;    &lt;username&gt;${jdbc.username}&lt;/username&gt;    &lt;password&gt;${jdbc.password}&lt;/password&gt;    &lt;url&gt;${jdbc.url}&amp;amp;sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0&lt;/url&gt;    &lt;src&gt;src/test/resources/sample-data.xml&lt;/src&gt;    &lt;type&gt;${dbunit.operation.type}&lt;/type&gt;    &lt;schema&gt;${dbunit.schema}&lt;/schema&gt;    &lt;skip&gt;${maven.test.skip}&lt;/skip&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div></div><p>Keep in mind that if you choose to do this your dbunit tests will run with constraints disabled....generally not a recommended approach. Caveat Emptor.</p></div>

<p>Congratulations to the jQuery crew for <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries" target="_blank" rel="external">properly documenting this one in their official documentation</a>. However, I didn't find that page with my first search so consider this post my effort to propagate the knowledge.</p><p>jQuery uses "$" as a shortcut for "jQuery" and that is generally its only point of conflict with other javascript libraries. You can override that behavior so that jQuery will play nice with others by calling</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>jQuery.noConflict();</pre></div></div>and then explicitly calling "jQuery" where you would have used "$" to invoke jQuery behavior. Read more on the page referenced above.</div>
