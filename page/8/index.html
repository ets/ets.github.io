<p>I experienced some intermittent and infuriating mouse malfunctions after my upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10.

Dear US Consumer Product Safety Commission<br>CC: everyone<br><p>    On the morning of June 27th 2009, electrical power to my household was briefly disrupted around 3:30am by several breaks in service over a period of about 20 seconds. Approximately 5 minutes after the disruption, I noticed thick black smoke billowing from a room housing several electronic devices. I was able to enter the room and identify the source of the smoke as the burning plastic of my Belkin "Conceal" Surge Protector. I was thankfully able to quickly terminate power to the device and remove the smoldering plastic from my home.</p><p>As the attached photos demonstrate, the heat from the Belkin burned several holes into the baseboard of the wall behind it and charred the surrounding floor and wall. At the time of the incident, there were only three devices plugged into the Belkin: a speaker, halogen lamp, and laptop computer. Both the speaker and lamp were powered off and the laptop was only drawing power as needed to replenish its battery. Aside from damage to their power cords all three devices were unharmed. I purchased this Belkin Surge Protector from Staples on July 25th 2007 (I have the original receipt) and it was never damaged, repaired, or modified in any way prior to this incident.</p><p>My wife &amp; eight-week old daughter were present in our home with me at the time of this incident. In addition to the obvious structural damage pictured, the room suffered significant smoke damage &amp; lingering odors from the toxic fumes. Clearly my family and I are lucky to have only experienced this relatively minor loss from such a potentially harmful incident. I am writing you today in the hope that this information may prevent other consumers from exposure to this potentially lethal &amp; hazardous product.</p><p>I have kept the product and would be happy to submit it for your inspection. The particulars of my Belkin are:<br>Model: BZ 111234-10<br>File No: E89769<br>Serial: 061016716-18079<br>Manufactured: Sept 02, 2006<br>Made in China<br></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz" height="640" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_ccgcz-scaled500.jpg?w=225" width="480"></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_vhtil-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img alt="Media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz" height="375" src="http://ericsimmerman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/media_httpwwwjrollerc_juddz-scaled1000.jpg?w=300" width="500"></a></div></div>

<div class="post">
<p>If DBUnit starts throwing MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException while performing a CLEAN_INSERT you can lose quite a bit of sleep attempting to resolve it or you can cheat and get back to work. The shortcut is to simply disable constraints for the INSERT operation by disabling constraints for DBUnit altogether. You can do that by adding sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 to your JDBC connection string to MySQL. I use maven and in pom.xml my configuration for the dbunit plugin looks like this</p><div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;&lt;artifactId&gt;dbunit-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;&lt;version&gt;1.0-beta-1&lt;/version&gt;&lt;configuration&gt;    &lt;dataTypeFactoryName&gt;${dbunit.dataTypeFactoryName}&lt;/dataTypeFactoryName&gt;    &lt;driver&gt;${jdbc.driverClassName}&lt;/driver&gt;    &lt;username&gt;${jdbc.username}&lt;/username&gt;    &lt;password&gt;${jdbc.password}&lt;/password&gt;    &lt;url&gt;${jdbc.url}&amp;amp;sessionVariables=FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0&lt;/url&gt;    &lt;src&gt;src/test/resources/sample-data.xml&lt;/src&gt;    &lt;type&gt;${dbunit.operation.type}&lt;/type&gt;    &lt;schema&gt;${dbunit.schema}&lt;/schema&gt;    &lt;skip&gt;${maven.test.skip}&lt;/skip&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div></div><p>Keep in mind that if you choose to do this your dbunit tests will run with constraints disabled....generally not a recommended approach. Caveat Emptor.</p></div>

<p>I recently struggled through the details of establishing a VPN connection from my Ubuntu 64 desktop to a Juniper Networks Netscreen-5. There are a number of ways to skin the VPN cat in linux and I'm not going to detail them all here. I'll just tell you how I solved it.</p>My Netscreen-5 was configured with some typical settings:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>Phase 1Pre-shared key &quot;your-pre-shared-key-here&quot;Encryption &quot;pre-g2-aes128-sha&quot;Phase 2Encryption &quot;g2-esp-3des-sha&quot;</pre></div></div>To configure the client-side, I decided to use Racoon and KVpnc:<ol><li>On my Jaunty install (Ubuntu 9.04) I first installed the repository version of racoon: <div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>apt-get install racoon</pre></div></div></li><li>Then I downloaded the latest build of KVpnc. They only had an intrepid build when I wrote this (kvpnc_0.9.1_intrepid-1_amd64.deb) and it worked for me, but it's worth <a href="http://home.gna.org/kvpnc/en/download.html" target="_blank" rel="external">checking if a Jaunty build is available</a>.</li><li>My Netscreen config translates to the following choices under KVpnc's Racoon options:<ul><li>sha1</li><li>aes</li><li>hmac_sha1</li><li>aes</li><li>agressive</li><li>modp1024</li><li>modp1024</li><li>Remote Identifier Type: asn1dn</li><li>Local Identifier Type: user_fqdn</li><li>Local Identifier Value: (we used email addresses for client ids on the netscreen so the Local Identifier value in KVpnc is an email address)</li></ul></li></ol><p>Your VPN gateway is entered under General and don't forget to complete the Network/General portion of your KVpnc profile as well. That's where your destination network goes (for a Host to Network configuration like mine).</p></div>

PHP and Ruby syntax are far enough apart that I was loathe to attempt a port of some working PHP scripts in my arsenal, but I needed to call said scripts from a relatively complex Ruby program. Fast &amp; dirty integration of this type is generally performed using a system call, but unlike most things Ruby I didn't find the Ruby way in this case to be all that intuitive.<br>The %x technique for the system call made it easy to read the output of my PHP program into a variable in the calling script.

<div class="post">
Using Spring MVC's checkboxes (or radiobuttons) tag to render form inputs for an enum property is easy and clean...once you know how. After a little gnashing of teeth, due to the fact that I needed a specific display order for all options, I found the following solution:<p>Here's the tag in my jsp<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;form:checkboxes itemValue=&quot;value&quot; itemLabel=&quot;label&quot;  path=&quot;user.degrees&quot; items=&quot;${degreeLabels }&quot; /&gt;</pre></div></div><br>Here's the way I populated my model map to retain ordering. (I placed this code in my FormController's referenceData method)<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>List labelValues = new ArrayList&lt;LabelValue&gt;();        for (Degree d : Degree.values()) {            labelValues.add(new LabelValue(d.name(), d.name()));        }        Map model = new HashMap();        model.put(&quot;degreeLabels&quot;, labelValues);</pre></div></div>FYI, I ripped the LabelValue class used above from Matt Riable's excellent Appfuse project. The constructor takes two arguments which are mapped to the properties "value" and "label" and these properties have the typical pojo getters and setters.<br>You can see from the path on my tag that degrees is a property on my User object...which is the target of my form. Here's what that looks like...I threw in my Hibernate annotations for the curious:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>private Set&lt;Degree&gt; degrees = new HashSet&lt;Degree&gt;();    @CollectionOfElements    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)    public Set&lt;Degree&gt; getDegrees() {        return degrees;    }    public void setDegrees(Set&lt;Degree&gt; degrees) {        this.degrees = degrees;    }</pre></div></div>It's probably obvious, but here's what the Degree enum looks like:<div class="CodeRay">  <div class="code"><pre>public enum Degree {    BA,BS,BN,BSW,MA,MS,MBA,MSN,MSW,MD,JD,PhD,PharmD,PsyD,Other;}</pre></div></div></p></div>
