	Requests generated HTTP response code 500 and my error logs showed the unhelpful message "Premature end of script headers"
	I verified all permissions and even disabled / re-enabled cgi-bin support through Plesk which installs a test script under cgi-bin/test/test.cgi
	Even the test script failed to run. It also generated the message "Premature end of script headers: test.cgi"
	I eventually resolved the issue with two changes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The domain's root folder in /var/www/vhosts was not owned by the domain user. So I fixed that with a chown command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the Plesk control panel, I had to disable "Perl" support and enable "CGI" support to get my perl scripts with the ".pl" extension to run under cgi-bin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
