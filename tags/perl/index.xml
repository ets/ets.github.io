	Requests generated HTTP response code 500 and my error logs showed the unhelpful message "Premature end of script headers"
	I verified all permissions and even disabled / re-enabled cgi-bin support through Plesk which installs a test script under cgi-bin/test/test.cgi
	Even the test script failed to run. It also generated the message "Premature end of script headers: test.cgi"
	I eventually resolved the issue with two changes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The domain's root folder in /var/www/vhosts was not owned by the domain user. So I fixed that with a chown command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the Plesk control panel, I had to disable "Perl" support and enable "CGI" support to get my perl scripts with the ".pl" extension to run under cgi-bin&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.gnucash.org/"&gt;GnuCash&lt;/a&gt; served me well while I was running Ubuntu as my primary desktop but since moving to a Mac Pro I've been disappointed in the performance and non-native nature of the GnuCash Mac port. I decided to migrate to &lt;a href="http://moneydance.com/"&gt;MoneyDance&lt;/a&gt; and was quickly dismayed to discover GnuCash's poor support for standards based exporting.This GnuCash wiki-entry &lt;a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_export_data.3F"&gt;describes a few convoluted approaches to data export&lt;/a&gt; but the items it references are hopelessly outdated and generally do not function for the latest stable release - reason enough to ditch GnuCash.MoneyDance hadn't solved the problem on their end either but their wiki does &lt;a href="http://moneydance.com/trac/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#CanIimportmyGnuCashdata"&gt;reference a Perl script that converts the deprecated GnuCash Postgre storage format into a MoneyDance XML file&lt;/a&gt;. Since I knew that the development release of GnuCash supports a SQLite storage format I decided to see if I could update Sid Reed's aforementioned script for this new SQLite container.I'm no Perl Monger, but &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/208/"&gt;I do know regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;. My updated script worked well for me and seamlessly converted several years of GnuCash data. Please read the pre-requisites section in the header of this&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ericsimmerman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GnuCash-MoneyDance-Importer.zip"&gt;GnuCash to MoneyDance Migration Script&lt;/a&gt; before attempting to run it. In addition to the linked zip archive, &lt;a href="http://github.com/ets/MoneyDance-GnuCash-Importer"&gt;this script is also available on github&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
